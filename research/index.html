A goal is what you want, a system is how you get there.\n\nWe might see no difference by doing something once, by starting a new habit. But over time, our actions and decisions compound, and after some time you will break the platou and reach higher limites.\n\nAs an example, you might workout once, and see no difference. Workout for a month, and see no difference, but with time, you will get fit. It's not about what you do once. It's about what you do every single day that impacts your life and your outcomes.\n\nThe same habits produce the same outcomes. Change your habits and you will change your outcomes.\n\n\u003e TODO for self: Get better at building my systems, not setting goals. It's far important having a good system rather than just setting goals.\n\nBreaking bad habits also takes time, but it's a matter of what we decide to do each day. Every single decision we make matters in the long run.\n\nEven an average person with the right habits can become expectional. It's all about the compound effect of habits.\n\nEvery habit can be started instantly. Make it atomic, the smallest thing you can handle, and start from there. This can be applied to anything, such as working out, gaining knowledge, building a business and so on. Start small, grow from there.",lastmodified:"2022-02-02T06:53:34.024605026Z",title:"Atomic Habits | Notes"},"/Master_Plans/2022/2022-Master-Plan":{content:"My 2022 capacity will be `1009 hours`, I've written an article about it [here](https://theboringteam.com/7-easy-steps-to-know-how-much-you-can-achieve-in-2022-d42bf182a5c8).\n\nBase pillars of 2022:\n\n*Note: A goal must be defiend clearly and must be in my control, it must also have a clear end destination to be marked as completed*\n\n### Health\n- Get dental implants done\n- Work out on a regular basis (this isn't a clear goal with an end, must reformulate) ⭐\n- Reduce my mental tiredness by reducing the amount of junk content that is consumed by my mind.\n	- Reduce Netflix watchtime to (2 Episodes OR 1 Movie) / week. \n	- Reduce Youtube watchtime for ENTERTAINMENT to 1 hour / week.\n	- Reduce any other social media (Instagram / Facebook) consumed time to 30 minutes / week.\n	- =\u003e Total of ~4 hours / week of entertainment content consumed.\n	- =\u003e Total of 4 hours x 52 weeks = 208 hours MAX of entertainment in 2022. \n	- These hours to not count for audio books / music/ courses etc.\n- Shower every morning. Even if it's a quick 3-4 minutes. This helps kick the day off and be more productive and in a happier mood.\n\n### Business\n- Grow The Boring Team to a 5000 RON / month business (todo: define what is in my control)\n- Publish a paid course (todo: define what kind of course and where)\n- Grow online presence\n	- Medium: 5000 Followers\n		- Publish 100 Articles ⭐\n	- Discord: 500 Members\n\n### Financial\n- Have 20,000 Euros saved up (maybe less savings and more investments?)\n	- [Net worth forecast](https://1drv.ms/x/s!ApcHs7l0oRbYgms-eoMdZfG3Rmb0?e=llCl5c)\n- Grow my assets to 10,000 Euros\n- Have a personal income of 10,000 RON / month by the end of the year\n\n### Knowledge\n- [2022 Reading List](https://www.notion.so/c5f483d35ccc4e6fb30d92eff9c00dc9?v=e808a55c2ca1419281e3f91ba0707ab7) [402 hours] ⭐\n	- Listen books instead of reading, could reduce reading time by half.\n- Obtain the following certifications:\n	- Azure DevOps Engineer (AZ-400)\n	- Azure Solutions Architect Expert (AZ-303 + AZ-304)\n	- Professional Scrum Master I ⭐\n	- Professional Scrum Master II ⭐\n	- Professional Scrum Master III\n- Obtain an unbreakable knowledge about Data Structures \u0026 Algorithms.\n	- This goal is for code interviews.\n\n### Personal\n- 26 Retrospective Sessions [13 Hours] ⭐\n- 13 Anchoring Sessions. [6.5 Hours] ⭐\n\n#### Important notes:\n- Mental and physical health should be top notch priorities in 2022. I will do anything in my power to improve these 2 areas. Professional achievement grows a hundred times faster with a strong mind and body. Examples:\n	- DON'T NUKE MY BRAIN.\n	- Sleep well.\n	- Don't overeat.\n	- Limit junk content consumed by my mind.\n	- Workout more.\n	- Eat healthy food.\n	- Don't drink too much coke.\n\n- I want to leave my comfort zone as much as possible in 2022. This means going through hard and awkward conversations, trying something totally new or something risky. The more I leave my comfort zone the more I can grow.\n\n- I must be in a flow state as much as I can during 2022, to always align with my goals such as they are both the right difficulty, the right direction and always keep me on the edge.\n\n- What I have learned from my [[2021 Achievements]] is that the course of life constantly changes in a year. A part of the objectives will change dramatically in a year's time. An addition I want to make to my 2022 Masterplan is to constatly improve it throughout the year. This includes the following things:\n	- Every other Sunday morning at 10 AM I will have a retrospective of how the master plan is going so far and what can be done to improve it. These will be called \"Retrospective Sessions\". Each Restrospective Session will be at max 30 minutes.\n	- At every end of the month, I will make necessary changes to the 2022 masterplan. This can mean enhancements, discarding items, meditating if the direction I'm going in is correct and totally changing items. This will be done in direct relationship with the retrospective. These will be called \"Anchoring Session\". Each Anchoring Session will be at max 30 minutes.\n\n- I want to only have meaningful bookmarks in my browser. Here are rules I want to apply to my 2022 and future bookmarks:\n	- No music should be bookmarked (youtube or spotify etc.)\n	- No \"wish to explore\" pages should be bookmarked. Instead, I will put interesting pages I want to explore in an Obsidian note.\n	- Only truly essential pages should be bookmarked.\n	- Articles must be put in the \"Reading list\" page, and must be read within 7 days.\n\n- I want to have more output than input in 2022. This means producing more content than I consume. \n\nIdeas:\n- Manage my week better using Google Calendar. ✅\n\nWhat/How do I want to be at the end of 2022?\n\n### Quaters:\n#### Q1\n[Q1 2022 - Plan](Master_Plans/2022/Q1/Q1%202022%20-%20Plan.md)\n[Q1 2022 - Progress](Master_Plans/2022/Q1/Q1%202022%20-%20Progress.md)\n\n#### Q2\n[Q2 2022](Master_Plans/2022/Q2%202022.md)\n\n#### Q3\n[Q3 2022](Master_Plans/2022/Q3%202022.md)\n\n#### Q4\n[Q4 2022](Master_Plans/2022/Q4%202022.md)\n\n### Iteration Changes\n[Iteration 1](Master_Plans/2022/Iteration%20Changes/Iteration%201.md)",lastmodified:"2022-02-02T06:53:34.024605026Z",title:"2022 Master Plan"},"/Master_Plans/2022/Q1/Anchors/Anchor-Month-1":{content:"#### Quarter Changes\n- Publishing 2 articles per week is not a priority.

If I can turn it into 20 hours / certification I can save 20 hours.\n- Could I outsource the publishing of articles on Medium? I want to try it in this quarter. Pay / get someone to publish 2 articles / week for The Boring Team. This could shave off 25 hours from the quarter and 100 hours from the year. In the long term, it could become a passive income machine (if I pay less for the article than it makes)\n- With income from the business I want to start outsourcing development time as well on the project since it's the biggest chunk of time consumed in a quarter.

I think this is because I'm bored. I should find another productive activity that can replace this habit. Watching Youtube or Netflix is really easy, so the replacement should be easy enough and attractive to do. 🚧\n- Playing with friends is really fun and makes me happy.

This also helps waking up at 7:30 to always take a shower at the start of the day.\n- Instead of listening to audio books while eating, I will be listening to them while doing house work.\n- I believe I haven't eaten properly in the correct amounts and the correct time because I was bored or stressed. To break this habit, whenever I feel the urge to eat at the wrong time or the wrong amounts, I will take a 5 minute walk outside. This should break the bad habit. If I don't feel like going outside for a walk, then it's not worth eating yet.\n- I will no longer eat processed (frozen) food more than twice a week.\n- As long as I manage to complete all of my goals, I will not spend too much time playing videogames.\n- If I want to work late (after 9 PM), I will take a 30 minute nap beforehand.\n- There are too many improvements to be made from this point on forward.

All processes must be able to run on the shared kernel.\n\nEach container has its own set of "namespaces" (isolated views), some examples being:\n	- PID: process IDs\n	- USER: user and group IDs\n	- UTS: hostname and domain name\n	- NS: mount points\n	- NET: network devices, stacks, ports\n	- IPC: inter-process communications, message queues\n\nAnother feature of the Linux Kernel is the `cgroups`. They allow to monitor and control the resources of the containers.\n\nOther than the Linux Kernel itself, there is nothing special about containers. What makes containers useful is the tooling that surrounds them.\n\n#### Difference between VM and Container\nA Virtual Machine comes with a full-blown operating system built into it. On the other hand, Docker Containers use the Base OS/Kernel to run processes. This makes them much faster to run than VMs and are also lightweight. Containers share the same base Kernel.\n\nContainers don\'t replace Virtual Machines, they can run on top of them. This is often useful to completement the needs of the Virtual Machine.\n\n#### Docker\nWhat is Docker?\n\nDocker is a tooling to manage containers. It simplifies existing technology to enable it for the masses.\nIt also enables developers to use containers for their application, by packaging dependencies in their containers and enabling the "build once, run anywhere" strategy.\n\n#### The benefits of Containers\n- They solve the "But it works on my machine" problem.\n- They\'re lightweight and fast.\n- They have better resource utilization. A lot more Containers can fit into a host rather than VMs. =\u003e it saves money.\n- It provides a standard developer to operations interface: `docker run`.\n- Both an ecosystem and tooling exist for Containers.\n\n#### Docker Commands\nUse the following command to run your first container:\n\n```bash\ndocker container run -t ubuntu top\n```\n\nThis will allow us to run a container with the Ubuntu image. The `-t` flag allocates a pseudo-TTY, which you need for the `top` command to work properly.\n\nThe `docker run` command first starts a `docker pull` to download the Ubuntu image onto your host. After its downloaded, it will start the container.\n\n`top` is a Linux utility that prints the processes on a system and orders them by resource consumption.\n\nUse the following command to run bash inside of the Ubuntu container:\n\n```bash\ndocker container exec -it \u003ccontainerID\u003e bash\n```\n\nThe flag `-it` makes it interactive.\n\nYou can use the following command to see the running processes inside the Ubuntu container:\n\n```bash\nps -ef\n```',lastmodified:"2022-02-02T06:53:34.028605067Z",title:"Docker Research"},"/Research/NextJS/NextJS-Episode-1":{content:"### NextJS - Episode 1: Introduction\nEstimated script reading time **~5 minutes**.\n\nEstimated video time **~10 minutes**.\n\nTo view the sliders, click [here](https://www.canva.com/design/DAE1Nqki-9M/KWKN8pUir5HhoT44o8UrQA/view?utm_content=DAE1Nqki-9M\u0026utm_campaign=designshare\u0026utm_medium=link\u0026utm_source=publishsharelink).\n\n#### Introduction ~ 0.5 minutes\nHi everyone and welcome to the first episode in this series. I'll be covering everything you need to know to get started with NextJS and create your own projects. This is a hands-on course, where you can follow along coding. We'll be building a simple Movie app while covering the core concepts of NextJS, and you will be able to publish it at the end of the course.\n\n#### What is NextJS? ~0.8 minutes\nBefore I dive any deeper, let's take some time to look at what NextJS is and what it can offer.\n\n🎬 *Display a slider with information about the NextJS features*\n\nNextJS is a **React Framework** that aims to have the best developer experience, and also comes with many built in features, such as:\n- Page based routing\n- Pre-rendering, including both Static Generation and Server Side Rendering (more on that later)\n- Image optimization.\n- Fast Refresh.\n- Typescript support.\n- And many more.\n\nPre-rendering is one of the key features that make NextJS truly a powerful framework, let's see what pre-rendering is and what it does under the hood.\n\n🎬 *Display slider with NextJS pre-rendering SSG vs SSR*\n\n#### Pre-rendering ~1.3 minutes\nBy default, NextJS pre-renders every page. This means that NextJS generates the HTML needed for each page in advance, instead of having it all done by client-side javascript. This results in better performance and SEO.\n\nThere are two forms of pre-rendering Static Generation (SSG) and Server Side Rendering (SSR). The difference between them is in **when** NextJS generated the HTML for a page.\n\nFor Static Generation, which is always recommended when possible, HTML is generated at **build time**, and will be reused on each request.\n\nFor Server Side Rendering, the HTML will be generated on **each request**.\n\n🎬 *Display slider with NextJS Pre-rendering hydration*\n\nEach HTML file from the pre-rendered pages comes with minimal javascript neccessary for that page. When the page is loaded, the js code gets executed and makes the page fully interactive. This process is called hydration.\n\nFor now, this is everything you need to know to get started with NextJS. I'll dive deeper into the other concepts whenever I will be making use of them. Now, let's setup everything we need to get started.\n\n#### Setup ~0.7 minutes\nFirst off, be sure to install the latest stable version of [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)  (Version MUST be \u003e= 12.22.0). You can check if you have node installed by opening up the command prompt and typing in `node -v`. If it's installed, the node version on your computer will appear on the screen. The links to everything you need to download will be in the video description down below.\n\nSecondly, you will need an IDE. My personal preference is VS Code, which you can download from [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/).\n\nThat's all you need to get started. Let's create the base NextJS project.\n\n#### Creating the base project ~1.7 minutes\nOpen up VS Code and select the folder in which you'd like to create the project, personally, I will create my project here, I will name my folder NextJS, and click Select Folder. After that, go to the command prompt in VS Code by going up here and clicking on Terminal and then New Terminal or by pressing **CTRL + ~** on your keyboard. To create a new NextJS project, we're going to use the following command:\n```\nnpx create-next-app@latest nextjs-movies --typescript\n```\nHere, `nextjs-movies` is the name of the folder where the NextJS app will be created. The flag `--typescript` indicates that we're going to be using Typescript in this project.\n\n🎬 *Run commands*\n\nNow that the files have been created, type in the following commands to run the project locally\n```\ncd nextjs-movies\nnpm run dev\n```\n\n🎬 *Run commands*\n\nTo view your project, go to localhost:3000 or press **CTRL + Click** on the URL that appears in the command prompt. If everything went as expected, we should see the base NextJS project running. All of the content on the page was automatically created when we ran the scripts, and it can be edited. Let's make a change to see Fast Refresh in action.\n\nThe content of the main page are situated in the `pages/index.tsx` file. Here you can edit anything, and it will be updated instantly on the browser without the need to refresh. \n\n🎬 *Proceed to change some text on the main page*\n\nBe sure to save the file and have the development server running. As you can see, the browser updated instantly. That's Fast Refresh in action. We have instant feedback on any changes we make in our files.\n\n#### Ending ~0.3 minutes\nIn the next episode, we'll take a look at navigation in NextJS and how to have multiple pages in our app, since currently theres only this one. Tune in for the next episode to learn more.

In this one, we're going to create a new page in the existing project and implement routing back and forth between the main page and the new page. \n\nAs always, you can follow along coding. For everything presented in the video, there is a github repository with the full code. You can view the code for each episode by checking out that specific branch.\n\n🎬 *Show github repository and branches*\n\n#### Creating a new page\nBefore we get into how to create a page in NextJS, we must understand what's going on underneath.\n\n🏞️ *Display NextJS Routing slider*\n\nRouting in NextJS is composed of two major elements: Pages and Links.\n\nA page in NextJS is a React Component exported from the `pages` directory. These are the phisical pages that the user sees when browsing the website.\n\nOn the other hand, Links are special React Components that connect pages together and allow the user to navigate between them.\n\nLet's take a look at how NextJS pages are mapped in the browser.\n\n🏞️ *Display NextJS URL Mapping slider*\n\nPages are associated with a route based on their file name. For example:\n- `pages/car.tsx` will be at the `/car` route\n- `pages/movie.tsx` will be at the `/movie` route\n\nThere is a special case, when the page name is `index`\n- `pages/index.tsx` will be at the `/` route\n\nThis is because index is a special keyword in NextJS, noting that the specified page is the entrypoint of the website.\n\nRoutes can also be nested, for example\n- `pages/cars/tesla.tsx` will be at the `/cars/tesla` route\n- `pages/movies/iron-man.tsx` will be at the `/movies/iron-man` route\n\n🏞️ *Close sliders*\n\nLet's create our first page. Go over to the `/pages` directory, right click and create a new file. You can name this file anything, but if you want to follow along, I will be naming it `movie.tsx`.\n\nAs I've said before, NextJS pages are just React components underneath. Here, we just need to export a component, but it's very important to export it as default, otherwise NextJS will not recognize it properly. So, let's do just that.\n\n```tsx\nexport default function Movie() {\n\n}\n```\n\nand for now, let's make it return a simple message, such as \"My first movie page!\"\n\n```tsx\nexport default function Movie() {\n return \u003cdiv\u003eMy first movie page!\u003c/div\u003e;\n}\n```\n\nLet's run the server by typing\n\n```\nnpm run dev\n```\n\nWe can see the new page we've created by going to the `/movie` route in the browser, so let's type that in. And there we go, the message \"My first movie page!\" appears. Fast refresh also still works, and you can see that by changing the message inside vscode.\n\nSweet, now we know how to create pages. Let's see how to connect them and enable navigation from one to the other.\n\n#### Navigation\nNormally, when linking pages in HTML, an `\u003ca\u003e\u003c/a\u003e` tag is used. In NextJS it's very similar, the only difference being that the `a` tag is wrapped in a `Link` component that is exported from `next/link`. The `href` attribute is also moved from the `a` tag to the `Link` component.\n\nIn our case, let's begin by creating a Link from the `/movie` route back to the `/` route.\n\nFirst off, import the `Link` component\n\n```tsx\nimport Link from \"next/link\";\n```\n\nthen, down here create a Link that goes to the `/` route.\n\n```tsx\n\u003cLink href=\"/\"\u003e\u003c/Link\u003e\n```\n\nInside of it, put the `a` tag and also some text, such as \"Homepage\".\n\n```tsx\n \u003cLink href=\"/\"\u003e\n  \u003ca\u003eHomepage\u003c/a\u003e\n \u003c/Link\u003e\n```\n\nLet's test it by going to the `/movie` route in the browser. Click on \"Homepage\", and there we go, it worked! As you have seen, it also used client-side navigation, since there was no refresh when we clicked the link.\n\n🎬 *Go on the previous page in the browser and click on homepage again and show that there is no refresh*\n\nAs you can see again.\n\nAwesome. Now, let's do the same process by linking the Homepage to the `movie` page\n\nGo to `index.tsx`  and import the Link component. Let's put ours right after the `h1` tag.\n\n```tsx\n\u003cLink href=\"/movie\"\u003e\n \u003ca\u003eMovie page\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/Link\u003e\n```\n\nInside of the `a` tag, I'm going to write \"Movie page\". \n\nSave the file, and let's see if it works!\n\n🎬 *Navigate back and forth 2-3 times between the homepage and the movie page*\n\nAs you can see, it works like a charm.\n\n#### Ending\nIn the next episode we'll take a look at how to change the metadata of a page, such as the title, how to work with assets, such as images, in an optimized way and how to load external scripts. \n\n🎬 *Display outro and link to next episode*",lastmodified:"2022-02-02T06:53:34.028605067Z",title:"NextJS - Episode 2"},"/Research/NextJS/NextJS-Episode-3":{content:"### NextJS - Episode 3: Assets, Metadata \u0026 Scripts\nEpisode 3 full code: [Github Repo](https://github.com/The-Boring-Team/nextjs-movies/tree/episode-3)\n\nSlides: [here](https://www.canva.com/design/DAE2kYMGntE/bgFHjKPmktCeX2z12Ve0LQ/view?utm_content=DAE2kYMGntE\u0026utm_campaign=designshare\u0026utm_medium=link\u0026utm_source=publishsharelink)🟡 In progress\n\n#### Introduction\n🏞️ *Display NextJS EP 3 Initial Slider*\n\nHi everyone and welcome to the third episode in this series. Now that we have a basic understanding of routing in NextJS, let's explore other interesting topics. In this episode, I'm going to cover how to work with assets, how to modify the metadata of a page, and how to load external scripts.\n\n#### Assets\n🏞️ *Display Assets slider*\n\nLet's start off with assets. All files that are not sources of code for your application can be considered assets. A few examples are images, videos, and SVGs.\n\nAll asset files in NextJS must be put inside of the `public` directory. This folder can also contain other useful data, such as the `favicon.ico`, `robots.txt`, Google Site Verification and any other static file. For this reason, files such as images are usually stored in an `images` folder inside the `public` directory.\n\n🏞️ *Display HTML img tag slider*\n\nWith regular HTML, you'd display an image in the browser in this way:\n\n```tsx\n\u003cimg src=\"/images/profile.jpg\" alt=\"Your Name\" /\u003e\n```\n\nHowever, this comes with many downsides you have to take care of, such as:\n- Ensuring your image is responsive on different screen sizes\n- Optimizing your images with a third-party tool or library\n- Only loading images when they enter the viewport\n\nNextJS removes this hurdle by offering a custom React component that takes care of all of those, the `Image` component.\n\n🎬 *Close slides*\n\nLet's see a practical example. I'm going to display a simple profile picture using the Image component.\n\nFirst off, I'm going to create the `images` folder inside the `public` directory. I have prepared a .png file for this, but you can use any other image. \n\n🎬 *Drag profile.png file inside the `images` folder*\n\nAfter we've done that, let's go to `movie.tsx` and import the Image component, which is exported from `next/image`.\n\n```tsx\nimport Image from 'next/image'\n```\n\nUnder the `Link` tag, create the `Image` component and inside of it, you must provide 4 properties:\n- src: The source of the image, in our case the path in the `public` directory: `/images/profile.png`\n- alt: An alternative text in case the image does not load or gets corrupted\n- width: 256\n- height: 256\n\n```tsx\n\u003cImage\n  src=\"/images/profile.png\"\n  alt=\"profile picture\"\n  width={256}\n  height={256}\n/\u003e\n```\n\nThe width and height are necessary for NextJS to let it know how much space it needs to hold for the image while it's still loading. This also solves a problem in web development known as Cumulative Layout Shift or CLS for short. CLS is also a metric used by Google Search Ranking to rank your website higher. So, be sure to use it whenever possible.\n\nLet's start the app and see if it works\n\n🎬 *Start the dev server*\n\nBefore I go to the `/movie` route, I want to show you something. I'm going to open console and go in the Network tab. \n\n🎬 *Open the Network tab*\n\nLet's hit refresh. As you can see, the profile picture has not loaded yet. That's because the image is not in this page. It will load when I go to the `movie` page. Let's try that.\n\n🎬 *Click the link on the homepage that goes to `/movie`*\n\nAs you see, it's right here.\n\nLet's see how to work with Metadata.\n\n#### Metadata\n🏞️ *Display metadata slider*\n\nMetadata refers to the information related to a page. This includes things such as the title of the page, the favicon and many more. In regular HTML, the `head` tag would be used for these things.\n\nNextJS offers a special component for this, which can be imported from `next/head`, and is used to modify anything normally present in the head tag.\n\n🎬 *Close slides*\n\nFor example, let's change the title of the page `movie`.\n\nGo inside the `movie.tsx` file and import the `Head` component.\n\n```tsx\nimport Head from \"next/head\";\n```\n\nThen, in the return statement, place it somewhere at the top.\n\nInside of it, let's open the `title` tag and change the page title to \"Iron Man\". \n\n```tsx\n\u003cHead\u003e\n  \u003ctitle\u003eIron Man\u003c/title\u003e\n\u003c/Head\u003e\n```\n\nSave your changes and go back to the browser. \n\n🎬 *Open browser in the /movie route*\n\nAs you can see, the page title is now Iron Man. \n\nYou can also change the favicon on this page by using the `link` tag, and giving it an image. Let's do that with the existing profile image.\n\n```tsx\n\u003cHead\u003e\n  \u003ctitle\u003eIron Man\u003c/title\u003e\n  \u003clink rel=\"icon\" href=\"/images/profile.png\" /\u003e\n\u003c/Head\u003e\n```\n\n🎬 *Open browser*\n\nAnd now the favicon has also changed. But, if you navigate back to the homepage, you'll also see that both the title and the favicon have changed. \n\n🎬 *Click the link to the homepage*\n\nThis is because in the `index.tsx` file, another `Head` tag is defined with other information.\n\nLastly, let's take a look at Third-Party Scripts.\n\n#### Third-Party JS\n🏞️ *Display third-party scripts slider*\n\nWhat I actually mean by third-party is a script that was not written by us, but we need it in our application. An example would be us having to use the Facebook SDK. This will be just an example, and I will delete it later since we don't actually need it. \n\n🎬 *Close slides*\n\nSo, to use the SDK, we'd need to import an external javascript file in our app. NextJS enables us to do that using the `Script` component, exported from `next/script`.\n\nLet's import it in the `movie` page.\n\nFirst off, go to `movie.tsx` and import the `Script` component.\n\n```tsx\nimport Script from 'next/script'\n```\n\nThen, right after the `Head` tag, open the `Script` tag with the source of the Facebook SKD, in this case, it's this link right here..\n\n```tsx\n\u003cScript\n  src=\"https://connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js\"\n/\u003e\n```\n\nOther attributes can be assigned to the `Script` tag that are not present in regular HTML, such as a loading strategy and a onLoad function.\n\nFor example, I'll be putting a strategy of `lazyOnLoad`, which tells NextJS to only load the script when the browser is not fetching any other data. As for the onLoad function, let's put the message `script loaded successfully.`\n\n```tsx\n\u003cScript\n  src=\"https://connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js\"\n  strategy=\"lazyOnload\"\n  onLoad={() =\u003e\n    console.log(`script loaded successfully.`)\n  }\n/\u003e\n```\n\nLet's go to the browser, open up the Network tab and hit refresh. \n\n🎬 *Follow previous line*\n\nWe can see that the sdk.js has loaded, and that in the console tab the message appears. \n\n🎬 *Go to the console tab*\n\nThe Facebook SDK populates the `window.FB` object, and you can see that by typing in `window.FB` in the console and hitting enter. \n\n🎬 *Follow previous line*\n\nAs you can see, there is a lot of stuff here provided by the SDK.\n\n#### Recap\n🏞️ *Display recap slider*\n\nAwesome. Before we go any further let's quickly recap what you've learned so far.\n\nYou've learned how to setup a new NextJS project, how to create create new pages and how to navigate between them, and also how to work with images, metadata and third-party scripts.\n\n#### Ending\n🏞️ *Display next episode slider*\n\nIn the next episode, we'll take a deeper look at pre-rendering and data fetching in NextJS.
