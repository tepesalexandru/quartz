I'll be covering everything you need to know to get started with NextJS and create your own projects. This is a hands-on course, where you can follow along coding. We'll be building a simple Movie app while covering the core concepts of NextJS, and you will be able to publish it at the end of the course.\n\n#### What is NextJS?\nBefore I dive any deeper, let's take some time to look at what NextJS is and what it can offer.\n\nNextJS is a **React Framework** that aims to have the best developer experience, and also comes with many built in features, such as:\n- Page based routing\n- Pre-rendering, including both Static Generation and Server Side Rendering (more on that later)\n- Image optimization.\n- Fast Refresh.\n- Typescript support.\n- And many more.\n\n![Image2](https://pomodoroapi44ff78.blob.core.windows.net/obsidian-courses/Courses/NextJS/Episode1/2.png)\n\nPre-rendering is one of the key features that make NextJS truly a powerful framework, let's see what pre-rendering is and what it does under the hood.\n\n#### Pre-rendering\nBy default, NextJS pre-renders every page. This means that NextJS generates the HTML needed for each page in advance, instead of having it all done by client-side javascript. This results in better performance and SEO.\n\nThere are two forms of pre-rendering Static Generation (SSG) and Server Side Rendering (SSR). The difference between them is in **when** NextJS generated the HTML for a page.\n\nFor Static Generation, which is always recommended when possible, HTML is generated at **build time**, and will be reused on each request.\n\nFor Server Side Rendering, the HTML will be generated on **each request**.\n\n![Image3](https://pomodoroapi44ff78.blob.core.windows.net/obsidian-courses/Courses/NextJS/Episode1/3.png)\n\nEach HTML file from the pre-rendered pages comes with minimal javascript neccessary for that page. When the page is loaded, the js code gets executed and makes the page fully interactive. This process is called hydration.\n\n![Image4](https://pomodoroapi44ff78.blob.core.windows.net/obsidian-courses/Courses/NextJS/Episode1/4.png)\n\nFor now, this is everything you need to know to get started with NextJS. I'll dive deeper into the other concepts whenever I will be making use of them. Now, let's setup everything we need to get started.\n\n#### Setup \nFirst off, be sure to install the latest stable version of [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)  (Version MUST be \u003e= 12.22.0). You can check if you have node installed by opening up the command prompt and typing in `node -v`. If it's installed, the node version on your computer will appear on the screen. The links to everything you need to download will be in the video description down below.\n\nSecondly, you will need an IDE. My personal preference is VS Code, which you can download from [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/).\n\nThat's all you need to get started. Let's create the base NextJS project.\n\n#### Creating the base project\nOpen up VS Code and select the folder in which you'd like to create the project.\nAfter that, go to the command prompt in VS Code and open up the terminal using **CTRL + ~**. \n\nTo create a new NextJS project, run the following command:\n\n```bash\nnpx create-next-app@latest nextjs-movies --typescript\n```\n\nHere, `nextjs-movies` is the name of the folder where the NextJS app will be created. The flag `--typescript` indicates that we're going to be using Typescript in this project.\n\nNow that the files have been created, type in the following commands to run the project locally\n\n```\ncd nextjs-movies\nnpm run dev\n```\n\nTo view your project, go to localhost:3000 or press **CTRL + Click** on the URL that appears in the command prompt. If everything went as expected, you should see the base NextJS project running. \n\nAll of the content on the page was automatically created when we ran the scripts, and it can be edited. Let's make a change to see Fast Refresh in action.\n\nThe content of the main page is situated in the `pages/index.tsx` file. Here you can edit anything, and it will be updated instantly on the browser without the need to refresh. \n\nTry editing something, and be sure to save the file and have the development server running. \n\nAs you can see, the browser updated instantly. That's Fast Refresh in action. We have instant feedback on any changes we make in our files.\n\n#### Ending\nIn the next lesson, we'll take a look at navigation in NextJS and how to have multiple pages in our app, since currently theres only this one. Tune in for the next episode to learn more. See you there!\n\n#### [NextJS - Lesson 2: Routing](Courses/NextJS/NextJS%20-%20Lesson%202.md)",lastmodified:"2022-02-15T19:50:19.024710262Z",title:"NextJS - Lesson 1: Introduction"},"/Courses/NextJS/NextJS-Lesson-2":{content:"Lesson 2 complete code: 📂 https://github.com/The-Boring-Team/nextjs-movies\n\n#### Introduction\nHi everyone and welcome to the second lesson. In this one, we're going to create a new page in the existing project and implement routing back and forth between the main page and the new page. \n\nAs always, you can follow along coding. For everything presented in the video, there is a github repository with the full code. You can view the code for each episode by checking out that specific branch.\n\n#### Creating a new page\nBefore we get into how to create a page in NextJS, we must understand what's going on underneath.\n\n![Image2](https://pomodoroapi44ff78.blob.core.windows.net/obsidian-courses/Courses/NextJS/Episode2/2.png)\n\nRouting in NextJS is composed of two major elements: Pages and Links.\n\nA page in NextJS is a React Component exported from the `pages` directory. These are the phisical pages that the user sees when browsing the website.\n\nOn the other hand, Links are special React Components that connect pages together and allow the user to navigate between them.\n\nLet's take a look at how NextJS pages are mapped in the browser.\n\n![Image3](https://pomodoroapi44ff78.blob.core.windows.net/obsidian-courses/Courses/NextJS/Episode2/3.png)\n\nPages are associated with a route based on their file name. For example:\n- `pages/car.tsx` will be at the `/car` route\n- `pages/movie.tsx` will be at the `/movie` route\n\nThere is a special case, when the page name is `index`\n- `pages/index.tsx` will be at the `/` route\n\nThis is because index is a special keyword in NextJS, noting that the specified page is the entrypoint of the website.\n\nRoutes can also be nested, for example\n- `pages/cars/tesla.tsx` will be at the `/cars/tesla` route\n- `pages/movies/iron-man.tsx` will be at the `/movies/iron-man` route\n\nLet's create our first page. \n\nGo over to the `/pages` directory, right click and create a new file. You can name this file anything, but if you want to follow along, I will be naming it `movie.tsx`.\n\nAs I've said before, NextJS pages are just React components underneath. Here, we just need to export a component, but it's very important to export it as default, otherwise NextJS will not recognize it properly. So, let's do just that.\n\n```tsx\nexport default function Movie() {\n\n}\n```\n\nand for now, let's make it return a simple message, such as \"My first movie page!\"\n\n```tsx\nexport default function Movie() {\n return \u003cdiv\u003eMy first movie page!\u003c/div\u003e;\n}\n```\n\nLet's run the server by typing\n\n```\nnpm run dev\n```\n\nWe can see the new page we've created by going to the `/movie` route in the browser, so let's type that in. And there we go, the message \"My first movie page!\" appears. Fast refresh also still works, and you can see that by changing the message inside vscode.\n\nSweet, now we know how to create pages. Let's see how to connect them and enable navigation from one to the other.\n\n#### Navigation\nNormally, when linking pages in HTML, an `\u003ca\u003e\u003c/a\u003e` tag is used. In NextJS it's very similar, the only difference being that the `a` tag is wrapped in a `Link` component that is exported from `next/link`. The `href` attribute is also moved from the `a` tag to the `Link` component.\n\nIn our case, let's begin by creating a Link from the `/movie` route back to the `/` route.\n\nFirst off, import the `Link` component\n\n```tsx\nimport Link from \"next/link\";\n```\n\nthen, down here create a Link that goes to the `/` route.\n\n```tsx\n\u003cLink href=\"/\"\u003e\u003c/Link\u003e\n```\n\nInside of it, put the `a` tag and also some text, such as \"Homepage\".\n\n```tsx\n \u003cLink href=\"/\"\u003e\n  \u003ca\u003eHomepage\u003c/a\u003e\n \u003c/Link\u003e\n```\n\nLet's test it by going to the `/movie` route in the browser. Click on \"Homepage\", and there we go, it worked! As you have seen, it also used client-side navigation, since there was no refresh when we clicked the link.\n\n🎬 *Go on the previous page in the browser and click on homepage again and show that there is no refresh*\n\nAs you can see again.\n\nAwesome. Now, let's do the same process by linking the Homepage to the `movie` page\n\nGo to `index.tsx`  and import the Link component. Let's put ours right after the `h1` tag.\n\n```tsx\n\u003cLink href=\"/movie\"\u003e\n \u003ca\u003eMovie page\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/Link\u003e\n```\n\nInside of the `a` tag, I'm going to write \"Movie page\". \n\nSave the file, and let's see if it works!\n\n🎬 *Navigate back and forth 2-3 times between the homepage and the movie page*\n\nAs you can see, it works like a charm.\n\n#### Ending\nIn the next lesson we'll take a look at how to change the metadata of a page, such as the title, how to work with assets, such as images, in an optimized way and how to load external scripts. \n\n#### [NextJS - Lesson 3: Assets, Metadata \u0026 Scripts](Courses/NextJS/NextJS%20-%20Lesson%203.md)",lastmodified:"2022-02-15T19:50:19.024710262Z",title:"NextJS - Lesson 2: Routing"},"/Courses/NextJS/NextJS-Lesson-3":{content:"Lesson 3 complete code: [Github Repo](https://github.com/The-Boring-Team/nextjs-movies/tree/episode-3)\n\n#### Introduction\nHi everyone and welcome to the third lesson. Now that we have a basic understanding of routing in NextJS, let's explore other interesting topics. In this episode, I'm going to cover how to work with assets, how to modify the metadata of a page, and how to load external scripts.\n\n#### Assets\n![Assets](https://pomodoroapi44ff78.blob.core.windows.net/obsidian-courses/Courses/NextJS/Episode3/2.png)\n\nLet's start off with assets. All files that are not sources of code for your application can be considered assets. A few examples are images, videos, and SVGs.\n\nAll asset files in NextJS must be put inside of the `public` directory. This folder can also contain other useful data, such as the `favicon.ico`, `robots.txt`, Google Site Verification and any other static file. For this reason, files such as images are usually stored in an `images` folder inside the `public` directory.\n\nWith regular HTML, you'd display an image in the browser in this way:\n\n```tsx\n\u003cimg src=\"/images/profile.jpg\" alt=\"Your Name\" /\u003e\n```\n\nHowever, this comes with many downsides you have to take care of, such as:\n- Ensuring your image is responsive on different screen sizes\n- Optimizing your images with a third-party tool or library\n- Only loading images when they enter the viewport\n\nNextJS removes this hurdle by offering a custom React component that takes care of all of those, the `Image` component.\n\nLet's see a practical example. I'm going to display a simple profile picture using the Image component.\n\nFirst off, I'm going to create the `images` folder inside the `public` directory. I have prepared a .png file for this, but you can use any other image. \n\n🎬 *Drag your .png file inside the `images` folder*\n\nAfter we've done that, let's go to `movie.tsx` and import the Image component, which is exported from `next/image`.\n\n```tsx\nimport Image from 'next/image'\n```\n\nUnder the `Link` tag, create the `Image` component and inside of it, you must provide 4 properties:\n- src: The source of the image, in our case the path in the `public` directory: `/images/profile.png`\n- alt: An alternative text in case the image does not load or gets corrupted\n- width: 256\n- height: 256\n\n```tsx\n\u003cImage\n  src=\"/images/profile.png\"\n  alt=\"profile picture\"\n  width={256}\n  height={256}\n/\u003e\n```\n\nThe width and height are necessary for NextJS to let it know how much space it needs to hold for the image while it's still loading. This also solves a problem in web development known as Cumulative Layout Shift or CLS for short. CLS is also a metric used by Google Search Ranking to rank your website higher. So, be sure to use it whenever possible.\n\nLet's start the app and see if it works\n\n🎬 *Start the dev server*\n\nBefore I go to the `/movie` route, I want to show you something. I'm going to open console and go in the Network tab. \n\n🎬 *Open the Network tab*\n\nLet's hit refresh. As you can see, the profile picture has not loaded yet. That's because the image is not in this page. It will load when I go to the `movie` page. Let's try that.\n\n🎬 *Click the link on the homepage that goes to `/movie`*\n\nAs you see, it's right here.\n\nLet's see how to work with Metadata.\n\n#### Metadata\n![Metadata](https://pomodoroapi44ff78.blob.core.windows.net/obsidian-courses/Courses/NextJS/Episode3/4.png)\n\nMetadata refers to the information related to a page. This includes things such as the title of the page, the favicon and many more. In regular HTML, the `head` tag would be used for these things.\n\nNextJS offers a special component for this, which can be imported from `next/head`, and is used to modify anything normally present in the head tag.\n\nFor example, let's change the title of the page `movie`.\n\nGo inside the `movie.tsx` file and import the `Head` component.\n\n```tsx\nimport Head from \"next/head\";\n```\n\nThen, in the return statement, place it somewhere at the top.\n\nInside of it, let's open the `title` tag and change the page title to \"Iron Man\". \n\n```tsx\n\u003cHead\u003e\n  \u003ctitle\u003eIron Man\u003c/title\u003e\n\u003c/Head\u003e\n```\n\nSave your changes and go back to the browser. \n\n🎬 *Open browser in the /movie route*\n\nAs you can see, the page title is now Iron Man. \n\nYou can also change the favicon on this page by using the `link` tag, and giving it an image. Let's do that with the existing profile image.\n\n```tsx\n\u003cHead\u003e\n  \u003ctitle\u003eIron Man\u003c/title\u003e\n  \u003clink rel=\"icon\" href=\"/images/profile.png\" /\u003e\n\u003c/Head\u003e\n```\n\n🎬 *Open browser*\n\nAnd now the favicon has also changed. But, if you navigate back to the homepage, you'll also see that both the title and the favicon have changed. \n\n🎬 *Click the link to the homepage*\n\nThis is because in the `index.tsx` file, another `Head` tag is defined with other information.\n\nLastly, let's take a look at Third-Party Scripts.\n\n#### Third-Party JS\n![Scripts](https://pomodoroapi44ff78.blob.core.windows.net/obsidian-courses/Courses/NextJS/Episode3/5.png)\n\nWhat I actually mean by third-party is a script that was not written by us, but we need it in our application. An example would be us having to use the Facebook SDK. This will be just an example, and I will delete it later since we don't actually need it. \n\nSo, to use the SDK, we'd need to import an external javascript file in our app. NextJS enables us to do that using the `Script` component, exported from `next/script`.\n\nLet's import it in the `movie` page.\n\nFirst off, go to `movie.tsx` and import the `Script` component.\n\n```tsx\nimport Script from 'next/script'\n```\n\nThen, right after the `Head` tag, open the `Script` tag with the source of the Facebook SKD, in this case, it's this link right here..\n\n```tsx\n\u003cScript\n  src=\"https://connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js\"\n/\u003e\n```\n\nOther attributes can be assigned to the `Script` tag that are not present in regular HTML, such as a loading strategy and a onLoad function.\n\nFor example, I'll be putting a strategy of `lazyOnLoad`, which tells NextJS to only load the script when the browser is not fetching any other data. As for the onLoad function, let's put the message `script loaded successfully.`\n\n```tsx\n\u003cScript\n  src=\"https://connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js\"\n  strategy=\"lazyOnload\"\n  onLoad={() =\u003e\n    console.log(`script loaded successfully.`)\n  }\n/\u003e\n```\n\nLet's go to the browser, open up the Network tab and hit refresh. \n\nWe can see that the sdk.js has loaded, and that in the console tab the message appears. \n\nThe Facebook SDK populates the `window.FB` object, and you can see that by typing in `window.FB` in the console and hitting enter. \n\nAs you can see, there is a lot of stuff here provided by the SDK.\n\n#### Recap\nAwesome. Before we go any further let's quickly recap what you've learned so far.\n\nYou've learned how to setup a new NextJS project, how to create create new pages and how to navigate between them, and also how to work with images, metadata and third-party scripts.\n\n#### Ending\nIn the next lesson, we'll take a deeper look at pre-rendering and data fetching in NextJS. See you soon!\n\n#### [NextJS - Lesson 4: Pre-Rendering \u0026 Data-Fetching](Courses/NextJS/NextJS%20-%20Lesson%204.md)",lastmodified:"2022-02-15T19:50:19.024710262Z",title:"NextJS - Lesson 3: Assets, Metadata \u0026 Scripts"},"/Courses/NextJS/NextJS-Lesson-4":{content:"🏞️ Episode 4 slider\n\n#### Introduction\nHi everyone and welcome to the fourth lesson. After understanding the basics, let's explore the core concepts behind the reason why NextJS is truly a powerful framework. \n\n🏞️ Introduction slider\n\nBy the end of this lesson, you will have learned:\n- Pre-rendering in NextJS\n- How Static Site Generation (SSG) works behind the scenes\n- How to import external data using `getStaticProps`\n\n#### Pre-rendering\nBefore we talk about data fetching, let's talk about one of the most important topics in NextJS: pre-rendering.\n\nI've covered the basics of pre-rendering in [Lesson 1](Courses/NextJS/NextJS%20-%20Lesson%201.md). In this lesson, we're going to build on that knowledge.\n\n### Static Site Generation\n🏞️ SSG with and without data\n\nStatic Site Generation, or SSG for short, can be done with or without data.\n\nBy default, all pages that do not require any form of data fetching are statically generated when the application is built for production.\n\nBut, you may run in the case that your page **does** need to fetch external data to be built properly. An example could be a blog article that needs to fetch the content inside of it. For this scenario, NextJS offers SSG wtih data.\n\n🏞️ *SSG with data*\n\nHow this process differs from SSG without data, is that all pages that require data fetching to be built, will fetch the needed information, insert it into the HTML file and store the result. \n\nThis process will happen only once, when the application is built for production.\n\nLet's see how this would look in practice.\n\n### The getStaticProps function\n🏞️ getStaticProps function\n\nTo fetch data for a static page when it is built, the `getStaticProps` function is used. The skeleton of the function looks like this.\n\n```tsx\nexport default function Home(props) { ... }\n\nexport async function getStaticProps(): GetStaticProps {\n  \n}\n```\n\nIt's usually placed in the same file as the component we want to fetch data for. In this example, it's for a component named Home. I've also added the `GetStaticProps` return type in order to make it type-safe.\n\nSo far, the function is empty. But, inside of it, we can fetch data coming from many sources, such as the file system, an API, a database, and so on. An example would look like this\n\n```tsx\nexport async function getStaticProps(): GetStaticProps {\n  const data = await fetchData();\n}\n```\n\nWe can use the `await` keyword to wait for the result since the function is asyncronous. The `fetchData()` function is a just a generic example of a function that you would build to fetch external data. We'll see a concrete example in our code in just a bit.\n\nLastly, the `getStaticProps` function, returns an object containing the props passed to the component.\n\n```tsx\nexport async function getStaticProps(): GetStaticProps {\n  const data = await fetchData();\n\n  return {\n    props: {\n      data\n	}\n  }\n}\n```\n\nNow, inside of the Home component, we have access to `props.data` and can work with it.\n\nEssentially, this whole process allows you to tell NextJS: \"This page has data dependencies, so when you pre-render this page at build time, make sure to resolve them first!\"\n\nAgain, the benefit of fetching data using `getStaticProps` is that the data is fetched at build time, not when the user requests the page. Therefore, the user can see the page instantly, without waiting for any data to load. \n\nLet's see how this process would look in our existing project. If you do not have the code you can clone it from the github repository by selecting the `episode 3` branch. \n\n### Implementing SSG\nFirst off, open up VS Code. I'm going to use the `getStaticProps` function to fetch data for the movie page.\n\nLet's go to `movie.tsx`, and under the component, write the empty function.\n\n```tsx\nexport default function Movie() { ... }\n\nexport async function getStaticProps(): GetStaticProps {\n\n}\n```\n\nFor this example, I'm going to fetch data from a `.json` file. The file does not exist yet, so let's create it.\n\nIn the base directory, create a new folder named `data` and inside of it, create a new file named `movie.json`. Inside of the file, insert the the following content.\n\n```JSON\n{\n  \"Title\": \"Iron Man\",\n  \"ReleaseYear\": 2008\n}\n```\n\nThis will be the data we want to fetch and pass to the `Movie` component. To access this data, I'm going to create my own custom function that reads the contents of this file. For this I'm going to create another folder named `lib` , and inside of it a file named `getMovieData.tsx`.\n\n```tsx\nimport fs from \"fs\";\nimport path from \"path\";\n\nconst dataDirectory = path.join(process.cwd(), \"data\");\n\nexport function getMovieData(): MovieProps {\n  const filePath = path.join(dataDirectory, \"movie.json\");\n  const fileContents = fs.readFileSync(filePath, \"utf-8\");\n  return JSON.parse(fileContents);\n}\n\nexport type MovieProps = {\n title: string;\n releaseYear: number;\n}\n```\n\nI won't go into detail about each line of code. In short, what this function does is that it finds the `movie.json` file in the file system, reads the content and returns it.\n\nI've also added a `type` for the Movie in order to get the benefits of typescript.\n\nGreat, now we can use this in the `getStaticProps` function to pass the object to the component. Let's go to `movie.tsx` , and fetch the data.\n\n```tsx\nexport async function getStaticProps(): GetStaticProps {\n  const movieData = getMovieData();\n}\n```\n\nAnd lastly, we have to pass it as props to the component.\n\n```tsx\nexport async function getStaticProps(): GetStaticProps {\n  const movieData = getMovieData();\n\n  return {\n    props: {\n      movieData,\n    },\n  };\n}\n```\n\nAwesome, now the data is going towards the `Movie` component. What we have to do now is accept the incoming data.\n\nFor that, above the `Movie` component, declare a new type for the props:\n\n```tsx\ntype Props = {\n  movieData: MovieProps;\n}\n```\n\nAnd then deconstruct the prop in the parameter of the function:\n\n```tsx\nexport default function Movie({ movieData }: Props)\n```\n\nAnd that's it! Now we have access to the movie prop inside of the component. Let's display the movie title and its release year.\n\n```tsx\nexport default function Movie({ movieData }: Props) {\n  return (\n    \u003cdiv\u003e\n    ...\n      \u003cdiv\u003e{movieData.title}\u003c/div\u003e\n      \u003cdiv\u003e{movieData.releaseYear}\u003c/div\u003e\n    \u003c/div\u003e\n  );\n}\n```\n\nSave the file and let's check the browser. \n\nAwesome! Everything is displayed correctly.\n\n### Next up\nIn the next episode, we'll explore how to create a page for each movie in our app using `dynamic routes`.
