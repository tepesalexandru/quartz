#### Introduction
Hi everyone and welcome to episode 6 in the NextJS series. In this one, we're going to tackle some very interesting topics. By the end of this episode, you will have learned how to:

üèûÔ∏è What you will learn slider

- Always fetch the most recent data using `Server Side Rendering`
- Implement the `getServerSideProps` function
- Optimize loading time of `external images`
- Improve the website's appearence using `CSS`

I'm going to build upon the code from last episode. If you want to follow along, be sure to clone the `episode-5` branch.

#### Server Side Rendering
Server Side Rendering, or SSR for short, is a form of pre-rendering. It's very similar to Static Site Generation, the only difference being that instead of fetching the data only once at build time, the data is fetched on every refresh of the page.

This is useful when you need the most recent data to be shown on the page. The downside of using SSR compared to SSG is that page load time increases and is no longer instant.

To fetch data using Server Side Rendering, the `getServerSideProps` function is used.

#### The getServerSideProps function
üèûÔ∏è getServerSideProps function

To fetch data for a page while its loading, the `getServerSideProps` function is used. The skeleton of the function looks like this:

```tsx
export default function Home(props: Props) { ... }

export const getServerSideProps: GetServerSideProps = async (context) => {
  
}
```

Since this function is executed when someone requests a page, we can access extra information about the request parameters. That information is contained in the `context` parameter.

Similar to `getStaticProps`, the `getServerSideProps` also returns an object with the `props` property:

```tsx
export const getServerSideProps: GetServerSideProps = async (context) => {
  return {
    props: {
      // component props
    }
  }
}
```

Let's go back to our project and implement Server Side Rendering on the Home component.

#### Implementing SSR
As always, let's open up VS Code. I'm going to use the `getServerSideProps` function in order to fetch the most popular movies and display them on the homepage.

Open the `index.tsx` file, and scroll down to the `getStaticProps` function. If you remember from last episode, we've already implemented the functionality of fetching the most popular movies, the only problem being that they are fetched only at build time.

As we all know, the list of popular movies changes frequently in real life. Therefore, it would be nice to always display the most recent information when we load the homepage. SSR allows us to do exactly that.

Let's refactor the pre-rendering method to be Server Side Rendering instead of Static Site Generation for this component.

It's quite simple, the only thing we have to change is the name of the function and its interface.

```tsx
export const getServerSideProps: GetServerSideProps = async () => {
  ...
};
```

Now, when we build the application for production the most recent information will be fetched on the home component.

üèûÔ∏è "The new problem" slide

But by doing this, a new problem arises. What if the list of popular movies updates, but we haven't statically generated the page for that movie? In a previous episode, we've seen that if the movie id wasn't present in the `getStaticPaths` function, then a `404 Page` would be displayed.

We don't want to show a `404 Page` for the new popular movies that appear. NextJS comes with a very handy solution for this exact problem. The `fallback` property inside of the `getStaticPaths` function.

üèûÔ∏è Fallback property slide

If `fallback` is set to `false`, then any page with an id that isn't present in the `paths` property, will return a `404 Page`.

If `fallback` is set to `"blocking"`, then any page with an id that isn't present in the `paths` property, will statically generate that page when it is requested for the first time, cache it for future requests and add its `id` to the `paths`.

This is exactly what we need. Let's go back to the project and open the `[id].tsx` file, where we have the `getStaticPaths` function. Here, lets set the `fallback` property to `"blocking"`.

Awesome, now the website is a lot more dynamic. From now on, we'll only improve the website appearence.

Let's begin by displaying the image of the movie after we click on it.

#### External Images
The `moviedb` API allows us to fetch the image of a particular movie. By reading [the docs](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/images) we see that the movie images are stored at this URL:

```
https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/original<movie-poster-path>
```

The poster path is a property that is present on each movie when we fetch them. Let's begin by adding this property to the `MovieProps` interface. Go to `types.ts` and add it there.

```tsx
export type MovieProps = {
  ...
  poster_path: string;
};
```

Back in the `[id].tsx` file, let's import the `Image` component:

```tsx
import Image from "next/image";
```

And above the movie title, display the movie image:

```tsx
<Image
  src={`https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/original${movieData.poster_path}`}
  alt="Movie image"
  height={400}
  width={300}
 />
```

Let's run the app in development mode to see what happens.

```
npm run dev
```

Open the browser, and click on any movie id. An error appears, saying that the hostname "image.tmdb.org" is not configured under images in your `next.config.js`. This is because by default, NextJS doesn't know how to optimize images coming from external sources. 

We can fix this error by going into the `next.config.js` file, and adding a new property named `images`, that contains the `domains` of possible sources for the external images. In our case, that would be "image.tmdb.org":

```tsx
const nextConfig = {
  reactStrictMode: true,
  images: {
    domains: ["image.tmdb.org"],
  },
};
```

Let's run the app again. Now, when we click on a movie, everything works correctly and the image is displayed.

Let's add some CSS to improve the page appearence and some other enhancements.

üèûÔ∏è Display finished design of the movie page (deployed to vercel)

This is the desired result of how the movie page should look. We have a landscape image of the movie, it's description, as well as the year it was released, it's length and its genres.

There is also a button to go back to the homepage.

Awesome, let's start implementing it.

#### CSS & Enhancements
First off, go to the `styles` folder and open `global.css`. Here, let's add a global style for the background, text color and font family:

```css
@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Montserrat:wght@300;400&display=swap');

...
body {
  ...
  background: #000814;
  color: #FFC300;
  font-family: 'Montserrat', sans-serif;
}
```

After that, let's create a new css file named `Movie.module.css` and import it in the `[id].tsx` file. 

```tsx
import styles from "../../styles/Movie.module.css";
```

Here, we'll put styles specific to the movie page.

Inside of the `Movie.module.css` file, I'm going to insert these styles:

```css
.container {
  padding: 42px 200px;
}

.chip {
  border: 1px solid #FFD60A;
  border-radius: 8px;
  padding: 8px;
  margin-right: 16px;
  display: inline;
}

.contentContainer {
  display: flex;
  gap: 24px;
}

.primaryContainer {
  flex: 3;
}

.secondaryContainer {
  flex: 1;
  padding-top: 8px;
}

.posterContainer {
  position: relative;
  aspect-ratio: 16/9;
}
```

> You can find these styles in the github repository for this episode.

Aside from this, let's also get more information from the API itself. Go to the `types.ts` file, and add the following properties to the `MovieProps` type:

```tsx
export type MovieProps = {
  ...
  backdrop_path: string;
  overview: string;
  genres: Genre[];
  runtime: number;
}
```

In order to keep the code clean, I'm going to create another type for the genres:

```tsx
export type Genre = {
  id: number;
  name: string;
};
```

Now we have everything we need to improve the movie page. Go inside the `[id].tsx` file, and inside the `Movie` component, add the following three variables:

The first, will be for the movie genres:

```tsx
const movieGenres: string = movieData.genres
  .map((genre: Genre) => genre.name)
  .join(", ");
```

> For this one, be sure to import the Genre type.

The second, for the release year:

```tsx
const releaseYear: number = new Date(movieData.release_date).getFullYear();
```

And the last, for the movie duration in hours and minutes:

```tsx
const movieDuration: string = 
  `${Math.floor(movieData.runtime / 60)} h ${movieData.runtime % 60} min`;
```

Now, let's get to the render function itself.

First, give the root div the class of `container`:

```tsx
  <div className={styles.container}>
```

Change the `title` of the page to match the movie title, and remove the dummy text under the `Head` component:

```tsx
<title>{movieData.title}</title>
```

Next, move the `div` containing the movie title and put it right under the `Link` component. Inside of it, enclose the text with an `h2` tag:

```tsx
<div>
  <h2>{movieData.title}</h2>
</div>
```

Under the `div` containing the movie title, insert the following structure:

```tsx
<div className={styles.contentContainer}>
  <div className={styles.primaryContainer}></div>
  <div className={styles.secondaryContainer}></div>
</div>
```

Here, we have two containers, one is called primary and will contain the movie image and description, while the other is the secondary container which will contain the movie release year, duration and genres.

Inside of the `primaryContainer`, insert a new `div` with the class of `posterContainer`. Inside of it, move the current image and remove the `height` and `width` properties. Instead, add a new property named `layout`, and assign it the value of `fill`. This will make the image fill the entire space occupied by the parent component.

```tsx
<div className={styles.posterContainer}>
  <Image
    src={`https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/original${movieData.backdrop_path}`}
    alt="Movie image"
    layout="fill"
  />
</div>
```

Also, be sure to change the Image `src` to be `backdrop_path` instead of `poster_path`. The difference being that `backdrop_path` gives us a landscape image instead of a portrait one. 

Under the `posterContainer`, let's add the movie description, which is contained in the `overview` property:

```tsx
<h5>About</h5>
<p>{movieData.overview}</p>
```

Lastly, let's move to the `secondaryContainer` and add the release year, movie duration and genres:

```tsx
<div className={styles.secondaryContainer}>
  <p className={styles.chip}>{releaseYear}</p>
  <p className={styles.chip}>{movieDuration}</p>
  <h5>Genres</h5>
  <span>{movieGenres}</span>
</div>
```

Awesome, those were all the improvements I wanted to add in. Let's build the app for production and run it:

```
npm run build
npm run start
```

Let's open the first movie, and there it is, everything works perfectly. You may notice that the first time you enter on a movie, the image takes some time to load, which is normal. After the first time, it will be cached and will load instantly.

We can verify this by going back to the homepage, and clicking on the first movie again. As you can see, the image loaded instantly.

### Next up
In the next episode, we'll improve the appearence of the homepage, we'll talk about `Layouts` in NextJS and we'll deploy the app using `Vercel`.
