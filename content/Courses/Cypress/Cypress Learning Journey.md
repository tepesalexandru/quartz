Hi everyone, and welcome to my Cypress learning journey. I have been curious about automating front-end tests for a while now, and decided to deep my toes into it. After some research, I found out about this awesome tool called Cypress that let's you write code that tests your front-end application. I've learned many cool things from this library, and I wanted to share them with you.

The course will be split into lessons that you can follow along and code while reading. Each lessons shouldn't take you more than 30 minutes to complete (it sure took me a lot longer to write!)

Anyway, I hope you enjoy the lessons I've put together down below, and learn something new.

### Lessons:
#### [Lesson 1: Introduction](Courses/Cypress/Cypress%20-%20Lesson%201.md)
