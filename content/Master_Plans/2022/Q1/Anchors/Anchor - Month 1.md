#### Quarter Changes
- Publishing 2 articles per week is not a priority. This goal will be removed from the plan and is only optional. Writing scripts for youtube videos is important right now.
- Working on the Pomodoro app has been discontinued. Publishing content online is the new direction that the business is going on.
- Time spend working out will be calculated per week rather than per workout.
- I have removed the Elon Musk audiobook from this quarter reads, since it was too boring and not very helpful.
