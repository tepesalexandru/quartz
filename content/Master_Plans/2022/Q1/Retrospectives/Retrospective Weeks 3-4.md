title: "Retrospective Weeks 3-4"
---
#### Transparency & Inspection
- Private Lessons are occupying 3 hours a week that I think I would enjoy more doing something else. ðŸš§
- Working out has been up and down, I need to be more serious about it. âœ…
- I have not respected eating in the correct amounts. âœ…
- Listening to audio books while eating was not enjoyable. âœ…
- Working 1 hour before work is really beneficial and not that hard to do. I will keep doing it. âœ…
- Working after 9 PM sometime feels like too much if I feel mentally tired. Perhaps with some rest beforehand its more managable. âœ…
- I have not always respected the time to eat. âœ…
- I have spent a lot more time on Youtube and Netflix than I should. I think this is because I'm bored. I should find another productive activity that can replace this habit. Watching Youtube or Netflix is really easy, so the replacement should be easy enough and attractive to do. ðŸš§
- Playing with friends is really fun and makes me happy. But, it should not take too much time on a weekly basis. âœ…
- I have not managed to shower at the start of each day. âœ…
- I think I've been feeling down lately because of eating a lot of frozen and processed foods. âœ…

#### Adaptation
- I will set a specific time of day and place to work out (jump rope) every day + how much time I will work out that day.
- I will set rest days for jump workouts.
- I will go to sleep at 22:30 instead of 23:00 to have more energy throughout the day. This also helps waking up at 7:30 to always take a shower at the start of the day.
- Instead of listening to audio books while eating, I will be listening to them while doing house work.
- I believe I haven't eaten properly in the correct amounts and the correct time because I was bored or stressed. To break this habit, whenever I feel the urge to eat at the wrong time or the wrong amounts, I will take a 5 minute walk outside. This should break the bad habit. If I don't feel like going outside for a walk, then it's not worth eating yet.
- I will no longer eat processed (frozen) food more than twice a week.
- As long as I manage to complete all of my goals, I will not spend too much time playing videogames.
- If I want to work late (after 9 PM), I will take a 30 minute nap beforehand.
- There are too many improvements to be made from this point on forward. Therefore, Private Lessons and Entertainment will be handled in the future.
