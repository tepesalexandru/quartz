title: "Retrospective Weeks 1-2"
---
#### Keep
- My private lessons are doing fine.

#### More
- Jump workouts have been going great, and I feel like I can push the limit every week by a bit.
- I need to study more in order to get the PSM I certification this month.
- Spend more time exploring interesting technologies.
- I should be doing more house work.
- The Master Plan and the Q1 Plan need more refinement.

#### Less
- I am spending more time on Youtube than the maximum limit set. Also, I have been spending some hours playing games, which I'm not sure if they fall under the definition of entertainment.
- I should eat less outside of regular meal times.

#### Improve
- I need to improve how much time I spend listening to audio books. A great idea would be to listen to them during lunch or dinner time. ✅
- I need to redcue the time I spend on Youtube. I can replace this time by exploring new technologies and learn more.
- Plan more study sessions for the PSM I certification. ✅
- I need to get back in the habit of taking a quick shower every time I wake up.
- Spend at least 1 hour refining the Master Plan. ✅
- I can start by always eating lunch on time, at 12:30. This will be a habit that grows with me and will be more stable with time. ✅
