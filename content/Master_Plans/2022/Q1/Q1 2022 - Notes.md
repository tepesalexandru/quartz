title: "Q1 Notes - 2022"
---

#### Important Notes:
- I am well over my capacity. I shall somehow speed up how much it takes for me to complete a task or do 2 tasks at the same time (such as listening to a book while doing another task). Another thing I can do is to take less time off.
- I have to speed up the process of getting the scrum master certification. 30 hours feels like a lot. If I can turn it into 20 hours / certification I can save 20 hours.
- Could I outsource the publishing of articles on Medium? I want to try it in this quarter. Pay / get someone to publish 2 articles / week for The Boring Team. This could shave off 25 hours from the quarter and 100 hours from the year. In the long term, it could become a passive income machine (if I pay less for the article than it makes)
- With income from the business I want to start outsourcing development time as well on the project since it's the biggest chunk of time consumed in a quarter. It may be not this quarter, but It has to start. My main goal shouldn't be developing the project, but managing it.
- I want to get the Professional Scrum Master I certification by the end of January.
