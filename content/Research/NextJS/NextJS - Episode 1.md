### NextJS - Episode 1: Introduction
Estimated script reading time **~5 minutes**.

Estimated video time **~10 minutes**.

#### Introduction ~ 0.5 minutes
Hi everyone and welcome to the first episode in this series. I'll be covering everything you need to know to get started with NextJS and create your own projects. This is a hands-on course, where you can follow along coding. We will be building a Note Taking app similar to Obsidian, and you will be able to publish it at the end of the course.

#### What is NextJS? ~0.8 minutes
Before I dive any deeper, let's take some time to look at what NextJS is and what it can offer.

NextJS is a **React Framework** that aims to have the best developer experience, and also comes with many built in features, such as:
- Page based routing
- Pre-rendering, including both Static Generation and Server Side Rendering (more on that later)
- Client side routing with optimized prefetching.
- Fast Refresh.
- Typescript support.
- And many more.

Pre-rendering is one of the key features that make NextJS truly a powerful framework, let's see what pre-rendering is and what it does under the hood.

#### Pre-rendering ~1.3 minutes
By default, NextJS pre-renders every page. This means that NextJS generates the HTML needed for each page in advance, instead of having it all done by client-side javascript. This results in better performance and SEO.

Each HTML file from the pre-rendered pages comes with minimal javascript neccessary for that page. When the page is loaded, the js code gets executed and makes the page fully interactive. This process is called hydration.

I've mentioned before that there are two forms of pre-rendering Static Generation (SSG) and Server Side Rendering (SSR). The difference between them is in **when** NextJS generated the HTML for a page.

For Static Generation, which is always recommended when possible, HTML is generated at **build time**, and will be reused on each request.

For Server Side Rendering, the HTML will be generated on **each request**.

For now, this is everything you need to know to get started with NextJS. I'll dive deeper into the other concepts whenever I will be making use of them. Now, let's setup everything we need to get started.

#### Setup ~0.7 minutes
First off, be sure to install the latest stable version of [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/). You can check if you have node installed by opening up the command prompt and typing in `node -v`. If it's installed, the node version on your computer will appear on the screen. The links to everything you need to download will be in the video description down below.

Secondly, you will need an IDE. My personal preference is VS Code, which you can download from [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

That's all you need to get started. Let's create the base NextJS project.

#### Creating the base project ~1.7 minutes
Open up the command prompt in VS Code by pressing **CTRL + ~** on your keyboard and type in
```
npx create-next-app@latest nextjs-notes --typescript
```
Here, `nextjs-notes` is the name of the folder where the NextJS app will be created. The flag `--typescript` indicates that we're going to be using Typescript in this project.

ðŸŽ¬ *Run commands*

Now that the files have been created, type in the following commands to run the project locally
```
cd nextjs-notes
npm run dev
```

ðŸŽ¬ *Run commands*

To view your project, go to localhost:3000 or press **CTRL + Click** on the URL that appears in the command prompt. If everything went as expected, we should see the base NextJS project running. All of the content on the page was automatically created when we ran the scripts, and it can be edited. Let's make a change to see Fast Refresh in action.

The content of the main page are situated in the `pages/index.js` file. Here you can edit anything, and it will be updated instantly on the browser without the need to refresh. 

ðŸŽ¬ *Proceed to change some text on the main page*

Be sure to save the file and have the development server running. As you can see, the browser updated instantly. That's Fast Refresh in action. We have instant feedback on any change we make in our files.
