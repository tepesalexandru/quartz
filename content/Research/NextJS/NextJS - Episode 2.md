### NextJS - Episode 2: Routing
Estimated script reading time **~0 minutes**.

Estimated video time **~0 minutes**.

#### Introduction
Hi everyone and welcome to the second episode in this series. In this one, we're going to create a new page in the existing project and implement routing back and forth between the main page and the new page. As always, you can follow along coding. For everything presented in the video, there is a github repository with the full code. You can see the code for each episode by checking out that specific branch.

#### Creating a new page
Before we get into how to create a page in NextJS, we must understand what's going on underneath.

ðŸŽ¬ *Display a slider with information about NextJS pages*

A page in NextJS is a React component exported from the `pages` directory.

Pages are associated with a route based on their file name. For example:
- `pages/car.tsx` will be at the `/car` route
- `pages/movie.tsx` will be at the `/movie` route

There is a special case, when the page name is `index`
- `pages/index.tsx` will be at the `/` route

This is because index is a special keyword in NextJS, noting that the specified page is the entrypoint of the website.

Routes can also be nested, for example
- `pages/posts/first-post.tsx` will be at the `/posts/first-post` route
- `pages/movies/iron-man.tsx` will be at the `/movies/iron-man` route

Let's create our first page. Go over to the `/pages` directory, right click and create a new file. You can name this file anything, but if you want to follow along, I will be naming it `movie.tsx`.

As I've said before, NextJS pages are just React components underneath. Here, we just need to export a component, but it's very important to export it as default, otherwise NextJS will not recognize it properly. So, let's do just that.

```movie.tsx
export default function Movie() {

}
```

and for now, let's make it return a simple message, such as "My first movie page!"

```movie.tsx
export default function Movie() {
 return <div>My first movie page!</div>;
}
```

This is all you need, but before we see if it works, we need to install the npm packages necessary to run the project with the typescript file (the one ending in .tsx). So, let's go to the command prompt, and type in the following command:

```
npm install --save-dev typescript @types/react
```

After the packages have been installed, let's run the server by typing

```
npm run dev
```

Something interesting has happened. NextJS detected that we're using typescript and automatically created extra files to integrate with it, such as the `tsconfig.json` file.

We can see the new page we've created by going to the `/movie` route in the browser, so let's type that in. And there we go, the message "My first movie page!" appears. Fast refresh also still works, and you can see that by changing the message inside vscode.

Sweet, now we know how to create pages. Let's see how to connect them and enable navigation from one to the other.
