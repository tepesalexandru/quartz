Today was a sad day most of the time. Yesterday I've received an interesting gift from Qubiz, an AirFryer. I can cook french fries without oil and some other meals. It also came with an air fryer cookbook from Qubiz, which was a nice addition to the gift. The gift was part of the Coffee Chat hosted at work by Marcel, and ended with a nice little Christmas party. Marcel told us about updates that happened at Qubiz and some new projects that are appearing, and then we headed to eat a lot of food. We even took some home. There were a lot of sweets too, I've eaten a lot of those, but mostly I've eaten regular food. A note about the food that we took home, I've eaten all of it when I came home yesterday. I have no idea why I did that, since I was already full from the party. My stomach was almost bursting but I still felt the need to eat all of the food. Let's explore some factors on why that could have happened:

- I was watching La Casa de Papel. While I'm watching things on Netflix, I have the habit to always eat something. That could be a major factor on why it happened.
- I drank Coca-Cola at the party. This drink has an interesting effect on me, giving me energy and all that, but mostly it gives me a sensation of hunger, and that's why it could also have happened.
- I felt tired that day. I've observed that in the days that I am tired, I eat a lot more than when I am well-rested.
