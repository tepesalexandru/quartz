-   Status is not the same as wealth. You can have a very high status even if you're not wealthy, such as a Pulitzer Award winner doesn't have to be wealthy to be very respected among his peers.
-   We are more likely to fight to keep our status than trying to change it.
-   Shame kills status.
-   You should think of status as two XY axes.
-   There are two types of people in a population: those who are dominant and those who seek affiliation.
-   Domination and Affiliation are two ways of seeing the world around us and measuring status.

<aside> 📃 Reading session #14 ⇒ page 135

</aside>

-   People who care about affiliation ask themselves the following questions:
    -   Who knows you?
    -   Who trusts you?
    -   Have you made things better?
    -   What is your circle like?
    -   Where do you stand within the tribe?
    -   Can't we all get along?
-   And for dominion:
    -   This is mine, not yours.
    -   Who has more power?
    -   I did this myself.
    -   My family needs more of what we already have.
    -   My side dominating your side means I don't have to be in charge, as long as my leader is winning.
-   Ask yourself the following question: The people you're seeking to serve, what are they measuring? And why?
-   Modern society, urban socity, the society of the internet, the arts and innovation are all built primarily on affiliation, not dominion.
-   This type of status is not "I'm better". It's "I'm connected, I'm family".
-   What kind of company do you want to work for?

> Dominion is a vertical experience, above or below. Affiliation is a horizontal one: Who’s standing next to me?

-   Restructure your business plan into these five categories: Truth, Assertions, Alternatives, People, Money.
    
-   The Truth section describes the world as it is. What market you are entering, the needs that exist, the competitors in your space, technology standards, and how others have succeeded and failed in the past.
    
-   The Assertions section is your chance to describe how you're going to change things. We will do X, and then Y will happen. We will build Z with this much money in this much time. We will present Q to the market, and the market will respond by taking this action.
    
-   The Alternatives section includes what happens if your initial assertions don't exactly pan out, since it's almost impossible to predict everything perfectly. This shows how much flexibility your product has.
    
-   The People section is all about who is going to join your team. This is not defined by their resume, but by their attitude and their ability to track record in shipping.
    
    -   For this section we can go deeper and analyze more about the people we're serving, such as their worldview, their view about status and so on.
-   The last section is all about Money. How much money do you need, how you are going to be spending it, what cash flow looks like, profit and loss, balance sheets, and exit strategies.
    
-   This might not be an official business plan that can be accepted by other officials, but it will for sure give you and your team clarity during hard times.
    
-   Remember, lose the focus from the question "How can I get more people to listen to me, how can I get the word out?..." and focus more on "What change do I seek to make?". Once you know what you stand for, the rest gets a lot easier.
    
-   A better business plan takes an universal need and makes it specific - describing who and what it's for. It outlines the tension you seek to create, the status roles you're engaging with, and the story you're bringing that will make change happen.
    
-   Remember, the above is not your purpose, it's not your mission. It's simply what you do. If it doesn't work, that's okay, it just means you've ruled out a route in your quest to matter. Now you can find a new one.

-   Marketing is not the same as Advertising|advertising
-   Marketing is about making change happen
-   Marketing is about creating a solution and seeking the people who need it
-   Advertising doesn't work anymore

> The other kind of marketing, the effective kind, is about understanding our customers’ worldview and desires so we can connect with them. It’s focused on being missed when you’re gone, on bringing more than people expect to those who trust us. It seeks volunteers, not victims.

<aside> 📃 Reading session #2 ⇒ page 27

-   First seek the people you want to help, then create a solution for them, not the other way around.
-   Never do marketing in a selfish way, it never works in the long run
-   Marketing isn't about becoming the "Amazon of something", its about providing a solution that people need, even if its on a smaller scale
-   People often do marketing in an old industrialized way (looking at graphs, spamming influencers, lowering prices etc.) but this is totally the wrong way of doing it. There is a more effective way than this and we can do it.
-   You shouldn't beg people to become your customer.
-   You shouldn't look for shortcuts, instead insist on a long, viable path.
-   Even millions of dollars in advertising can simply get ignored
-   The shortcuts of using money to buy attention to sell average stuff to average people are an artifact of another time, not the one we live in now.

-   Desire for gain versus avoidance of loss
-   To go shopping is to take a risk. Risking time and money for a new thing that might be great. We're able to take that risk because being wrong isn't fatal. Being wrong doesn't cost dinner or a medical checkup.
-   Our narrative is simply our narrative, if it's not working, it's arrogant to insist on it.
-   The way we make things better is by caring enough about those we serve to imagine the story that _they_ need to hear.
-   Marketing isn't a race to add more features for less money.
-   Marketing is our quest to make change on behalf of those we serve, and we do it by understanding the irrational forces that drive each of us.

> People don't want to buy a quarter-inch drill bit. They want to feel safe and respected.

-   People want your product for how it makes them feel. The thing you sell is simply a road to achieve those emotions, and we let everyone down when we focus on the tactics, not the outcomes.

> Sonder is defined as that moment when you realize that everyone around you has an internal life as rich and as conflicted as yours

-   Linear comparisons don't make sense when building stories and opportunities for humans. People view what you offer from multiple dimensions (ex: "stylish", "fashionable", "status") which can't be measured so easily.

-   Dog food is not marketed towards dogs. Is marketed towards dog owners. Have you ever seen a dog buy his own food? I haven't. Dog owners keep buying expensive dog food, and the price keeps rising, but how do they know that the food is getting tastier? They don't. They buy the dog food for how it makes them feel. The feeling of satisfaction of taking care of your dog, the status of buying a luxury good and the feeling of sharing it with your dog. Taste was never a factor.
-   You can't be perfect in the eyes of early adopters, the best you can do is be interesting.
-   Never forget the question "Who's it for?". The people you seek to serve, what do they believe, what do they want?
-   Conspiracy theorists believe in their theories because it makes them feel unique and different from the rest of the world. That's what they seek. To be unique.
-   People aren't eager to give you their attention. You paying for an ad doesn't mean it will be noticed. People trade their attention for something they need or want.
-   When a teenager buys a car, it enables him to go from dependent to independent. That's a shift in status, in perception and in power. It's far bigger than four wheels.
-   As a marketer, its like selling sand in a desert.
-   Customers hate selfish marketers.
-   You should graph in two axis features about your product and similar ones. Then study the graphs.

<aside> 📃 Reading session #7 ⇒ page 70

</aside>

-   When choosing with which axes to plot your product or service, you can see what problems you can solve. Each customer seeks different axis. Choose one and be the best in that axis.
-   In a hyper-competitive world like the current one, you should focus on the following things:
    -   Claims that are true, that you continually double down on.
    -   Claims that are generous, that exist as a service to the customer.
-   A teacher specialised in two axis is the following: "I'm serious, my students are serious, and this is about rigor" as one axis, and "My students win competitions" as the other one. Suddenly you have a teacher worth paying extra for.
-   Instead of choosing a popular quadrant (two axis), which is overcrowded and you would need advertising to be noticed, create your own quadrant. In that quadrant you will be the best choice and the obvious one since you're the only one there.
-   Out of these following emotions, which one does your product make its customers feel? Safe, Beautiful, Powerful, Worthy, Responsible, Smart, Connected, Hip
-   Making something easier to do makes change happen. It changes the world for the better. Examples: The refrigerator replaced the ice delivery man, the supermarket replaces the milk delivery man. Sending millions of emails in 1994 required a team of engineers and millions of dollars. Now you can send those same emails for just 9 dollars a month.
-   One more thing about sonder: We're not faking our points of view, our dreams, and our fears. And neither are you. If we can accept that people have embraced who they have become, it gets a lot easier to dance with them, not get them to admit that they were wrong. Simply dance with them.
-   Don't do what you do for your own benefit, but because of what it can produce for others.
-   Quality is not longer enough. If you can't deliver quality, this book isn't much help to you. If you can, congratulations. Now, let's set aside for a minute and remember that nearly everyone else can too.

<aside> 📃 Reading session #8 ⇒ page 84

-   Marketing is saying "There's a better alternative, come with me", instead of making average products for average people as their alternatives.
-   Stackoverflow was invented as a better alternative to Experts Exchange. But better for who? For the users.
-   Google was better than Yahoo! and Bing because it provided clarity on their homepage. It only had a searchbar and two links, while the others had dozens of links on their homepage and made the user feel overwhelmed. When using Google, you felt safe and confident since you couldn't possibly break it. Now, DuckDuckGo is better, for _some_ people. Each have their own separate audience.
-   Having a local bookstore that also sells coffee is a great idea since big online marketplaces cannot give you that same experience. Coffee connects people and creates memories in those people. The book they buy is just a souvenir that they've got along the way.
-   Authenticity in the marketplace is a myth. What people want is to be understood and to be served, not merely to witness whatever you feel like doing in a given moment.
-   Emotional labor makes you a professional and is needed to provide service.
-   Asking people what they want is a terrible idea when trying to come up with a breakthrough product. You must analyze the crowd on your own.
-   Never begin presenting your product by what you have done. Instead focus on the customers dreams, desires, wants and feelings.

<aside> 📃 Reading session #9 ⇒ page 91

</aside>

-   What do you want? Probably to be respected, successful, independent, appropriately busy, and maybe a little famous. You'd like to do work you're proud of and to do it for the people you care about. What's not on that list? That you need to own a certain color car.
-   It's tempting to make a boring product or service for everyone. The problem is that the marketplace of people who are happy with boring aren't looking for you. They're actively avoiding you, in fact.
-   The good news is that two massive shifts have happened:
    -   It's cheaper and faster than ever to create a prototype or a limited run.
    -   It's cheaper and faster than ever to find early adopters, to engage with people who want to hear from you.
-   Always be seeking, connecting, solving, asserting, believing, seeing, and yes, testing. The other way to read this is "always be wrong". Well, not always. Sometimes you'll be right. But most of the time, you'll be wrong. That's okay.
-   Being wrong from scatch can be exhausting. Radical originality doesn't have a high return on investment, and it will wear you out. Scrapbooking is an efficient alternative.
-   Scrapbooking means finding a product you like (website, email campaign, podcast etc.), find the things that you like in that product (ex: fonts, colors, animations etc.) and break them into individual pieces. Then rebuild something new on top of these pieces. That's how you can come up with a new project idea.
-   What's the difference between a 30 dollar massage and a 300 dollar massage? "More of the same" is the wrong answer. People don't spend 10 times as much for more words, a bigger order of French fries, or a louder stereo. Instead, it's a different extreme, a different story, a different sort of scarcity.
-   Without a doubt, the heart and soul of a thriving enterprise is the irrational pursuit of becoming irresistible.
-   Every very good customer gets you another one. Your best customers become your new salespeople.
-   Your work to change the culture thrives when the word spreads, and if you want the word to spread, you need to build something that works better when it gets spread. That creates the positive cycle you're seeking. The one that makes chance happen.
-   Metcalfe's Law
-   The truth about customer traction is that a miracle isn't going to happen.

-   Don't be fooled by trying to turn something average into something exceptional just with hype and ads. Dreaming that people will use your product just because its popular.
-   Good metrics to know if your product is a good one:
    -   How many people outside of HQ use it everyday?
    -   How often are they sending you suggestions to make it better?
    -   How many people are insisting that their friends and colleagues use it? As in _right now_.
    -   Do they love it? Do they love themselves more because they love you?
-   If you can't succeed in the small, why do you believe you will succeed in the large?
-   A thousand true fans is more than enough to have a sustainable lifestyle. A true fan is someone who will support you on Patreon even if you have a free YouTube channel.
-   Today's hits are meaningful for a few and invisible to the rest.
-   How the Grateful Dead became so successful:
    -   They appealed to a relatively tiny audience and focused all their energy on them.
    -   They didn't use radio to spread their ideas to the masses. Instead, they relied on fans to share the word, hand to hand, by encouraging them to tape their shows.
    -   Instead of hoping to encourage a large number of people to support them a little, they relied on a small number of true fans who supported them a lot.
    -   They picked the extremes on the XY axis (live concerts vs polished records, long jams for the fan family vs short hits for the radio) and owned them both.
    -   They gave the fans plenty to talk about and stand for. Insiders and outsiders.
-   Three needed things to pull off the above success:
    -   Extraordinary talent. You can't fake your way through 146 concerts in a year.
    -   Significant patience.
    -   The guts to be quirky.
-   Based on who somone is and what he wants and what he knows, he is right. Every time.
-   People are driven by the narrative "Do people like me do things like this?", examples:
    -   People like me don't cheat on their taxes.
    -   People like me own a car; we don't take the bus.
    -   People like me have a full-time job.
    -   People like me want to see the new James Bond movie.
-   You can view the people who use your product or service in layers. Be sure to have the strongest core possible.
-   Marketers don't make average stuff for average people. Marketers make change. And they do it by normalizing new behaviors.
-   It should be called "a culture" or "this culture", because there is no universal culture, no "us" that defines all of us.
-   Our job is to change "a culture". Therefore, begin by:
    -   Map and understand the worldview of the culture we seek to change
    -   Focus all our energy on this group. Ignore everyone else. Instead, focus on building and living a story that will resonate with the culture we are seeking to change.
-   That's how we make change. by caring enough to change a culture, and by being brave enough to pick just one.

-   When innovating, just just far enough. Just too far and the tribe won't follow.
-   When changing culture, begin with an exclusive cohort.
-   Your work is a tree. If your work is simply a commodity, a quick response to an obvious demand, then your roots don't run deep. It's unlikely that your tree will grow, or even if it does, it's unlikely to be seen as important, useful, or dominant. It will be crowded out by all the similar trees.
-   Work that matters for people who care is the shortest, most direct route to making a difference.

-   Pattern match/pattern interrupt. You're going to do one or the other.
-   Pattern match is doing what you've always done, watch the same shows, eat the same cereal, having the same haircut etc.
-   Pattern interrupt is when you're considering to try something new. This creates tension and most of the time you're not going to do it.
-   When you market to someone who doesn't have a pattern yet, you don't have to persuade them that their old choices were mistakes.
-   When life interferes, new patterns are established. This is why it's so easy to market things to new dads, women who got engaged or people moving out. They don't have a pattern yet.
-   Slack gave employees a new software for teams to collaborate. It's success was mainly from neophiliacs who liked new software and saw this as a pattern match, and then creating tension by telling their coworkers to join the platform as well. This created a pattern interrupt. It creates forward motion. And so, they became a multi-billion dollar company. Not by mistake, but by design.
-   All marketers who cause change cause tension.
-   All effective education creates tension, because just before you learn something, you're aware you don't know it (yet).
-   You can use tension to your own advantage in your life to move yourself and be better.
-   We don't want to feel left out, left behind, uninformed, or impotent. We want to get ahead. We want to be in sync. We want to do what people like us are doing.
    -   Where do we stand?
    -   What does the tribe think of us?
    -   Who's up, and who's down?
-   The only was to relieve tension is with forward motion.
-   The engine of culture is status.
-   We spend a lot of time paying attention to status. Almost every decision we make depends on it.
-   Status is our position in the hierarchy. It's also our perception of that position.
-   The desire to change our status, or to protect it, drives almost everything we do.
-   It's a mistake to believe everyone wants to make their status higher. In fact, few people do. It's also a mistake to believe that no one wants to make their status lower. This is mostly because you've probably been conditioned to see yourself in a certain status role.

> The smart marketer begins to realize that some people are open and hungry for a shift in status (up or down), while others will fight like crazy to maintain their roles.

-   Busy people (the ones you seek to serve) don't care about your work as much as you do. They scan instead of studying you, and the first thing they think about is "What does this remind me of?".
-   Be sure that when people see you, you remind them of something great. Of other great companies or other good work that you have done. If you remind them of scams, its incredibly hard to undo.
-   Don LaFontaine, a popular voice over actor worked on more than 5,000 pieces. That's not because he was the cheapest or was better at speaking than anyone else. But because he got a head start and it compounded. When he appeared in a new voice-over, his voice was familiar, it reminded people of his earlier works.
-   When making a product, send a signal that people trust, and then change your product just enough let people know that it's new and yours.
-   Apple is so successful not because of technology, but because of their genius use of semiotics. At every turn, Apple sends a signal, with just enough edge words, fonts, and design that the right people hear the message.
-   To change the culture, we have no choice but to acknowledge the culture we seek to change.
-   The people you are seeking to serve are trying to figure out who you are. If you're going to show up in their world, make it easy for them to know who you are and where you stand.
-   The lazy thing is to pretend that you don't need a flag. That your features are so good that you don't need anything else. Something else always matters.
-   What's your brand? Hint: It's not your logo.
-   In a crowded world, where about everything is "good enough", you're lucky if you have a brand at all.
-   If you have true fans, the only reason you do is because this group has engaged with you in a way that signals that they expect something worthwhile from you next time. That expectation isn't specific, it's emotional.
-   If you want to build a marketing asset, you need to invest in connection and other nontransferable properties. If people care, you've got a brand.
-   Your logo means less than your designer wants it to, but more than the typical committee realizes. If your brand is a shorthand for the promise that you make, then a logo is the post-it reminder of that promise. Without a brand, a logo is meaningless.

-   In a group of a hundred people, if you pick any measure (height, weight, IQ, number of Facebook friends and so on) you will see that most of them will clump around the average. This happens often enough that we call it standard deviation.
-   It turns out this is especially true for human behavior.
-   Don't focus your attention on people on the right side of the curve, those are hard to change. Focus your attention on the neophiliacs.
-   Gaining enrollment if fundamental when marketing.
-   Enrollment means hands raised, eyes on the board, notes being taken. Enrollment is the first step on a journey where you learn from the customer and she learns from you.

> Lazy marketers try to buy enrollment with flashy ads. The best marketers earn enrollment by seeking people who want the change being offered. And they do it by connecting people to others who want the change as well. And that change is precisely what marketers seek.

-   The affiliation-seeking tribe wants to fit in, to be in sync, to feel the pleasure of _people like us to things like this_ without the risk of being picked to be the leader.
    
-   Some people feel empty when they're not able to contribute.
    
-   Always treat different people differently, otherwise they will find someone who will.
    
-   When you find someone who is eager to talk about what you do, give him something to talk about. When you find someone who is itching to become a generous leader, give her the resources to lead.
    
-   We need to watch and listen to be able to figure out what to offer and who to offer it to.
    
-   When you ask, "Who's it for?" the answer needs to be, "The kind of customers who are going to show up for us in a way that lets us keep going."
    
-   You'll serve many people. You'll profit from a few. The whales pay for the minnows.
    
-   Treat your best clients with the very best you can.
    
-   Why isn't advertising the focus of all our marketing? Because online advertising is the most ignored advertising ever created.
    
-   There are two types of marketing: Brand marketing and Direct marketing
    
-   Direct marketing is action oriented. And it is measured.
    
-   Brand marketing is culturally oriented. And it can't be measured.
    
-   A simple guide to online direct marketing:
    
    -   The ad exists to get a click.
    -   The click exists to either make a sale or to earn permission.
    -   The sale exists to lead to another sale, or to word of mouth.
    -   Permission exists to lead to education and to a sale.
    
    That's it. Every step in the process has a cost. Assign a value to each step. If you can't, don't run any direct-response ads until you can.

-   The most important lesson about brand marketing is: you definitely, certainly, and surely don't have enough time and money to build a brand for everyone. You can't. Don't try. Be specific. Be very specific.
-   People don't remember what they read, what they hear, or even what they see. If they're lucky, people remember what they do, but they're not very good at that either. We remember what we rehearse.
-   We remember things that we see over and over again. That we do over and over.

> There are obvious evolutionary reasons we’re optimized for this. We have to prune memories relentlessly, and the easiest memories to prune are the ones that are random noise.

-   Along the way, this has pushed us to associate "trust" with the events and stories that happen again and again. The familiar is normal and the normal is trusted.
-   The market has been trained to associate frequency with trust. If you quit right in the middle of building that frequency, it's no wonder you never get a chance to earn the trust.
-   The path isn't to be found when someone types in a generic term on Google. The path is to have someone care enough about you and what you create that they'll type in your name. That they'll be looking for you, not your generic alternative.

> On the other hand, a smart marketer can build a product or service that’s worth searching for. Not the generic term, but to find you, the thing you built, the specific. When you do that, Google’s on your side. They actually want you to be found when someone searches for you

-   You cannot win in a generic search, but you'll always win if the search is specific enough.
    
-   There are two key things to keep in mind about pricing:
    
    -   Marketing changes your pricing
    -   Pricing changes your marketing
-   Are you the kind of person who buys the cheapest wine on the menu? What about the most expensive?
    
-   Notice that neither question said anything about the wine itself. Not about its taste or its value. Simply the price.
    
-   Of course, the price is more than a signal. It's also the engine for our project's growth, because price determines what we stand for, who we're designing for, and the story we tell. And price creates (or eliminates) margin, and that margin is the money that's available to spend on our outbound marketing.
    
-   The baker who charges 2 dollars a loaf has to sell 21 loaves for every loaf the luxury baker sells at 3 dollars. Twenty-one times as many is the difference between a few customers an hour or a line out the door.
    

> “But,” we say, “our customers would prefer to pay the lower price.”

-   Price is a signal.
-   When you're the cheapest, you're not promising change. You're promising the same, but cheaper.
-   Low price is the last refuge of a marketer who has run out of generous ideas.
-   The road out of this paradox* is to combine two offerings, married to each other:
    -   Free ideas that spread
    -   Expensive expressions of those ideas that are worth paying for.

> When a chef gives away her recipes, or appears on a podcast, or leads an online seminar, she’s giving her ideas away for free. It’s easy to find them, engage with them with frequency, and share them.

-   The rational thing is to believe that we're more likely to require trust before we engage in risky transactions.
-   And it's also rational to expect that people are more likely to want more trust before spending a lot of money (a form of risk). Or commiting time and effort.
-   Many times though, the opposite is true.

> When people are heavily invested (cash or reputation or effort), they often make up a story to justify their commitment. And that story carries trust.

-   Lowering your price does not make you more trusted. It does the opposite.

-   The USHG No-Tipping policy*
-   That story is not for everyone, but for the right people, it transforms the experience.
-   Always rememeber the following questions: Who's it for, what's it for, and how is status changed? _What will I tell the others?_
-   Permission Marketing is truly a powerful tool. It acknowledges that the customer attention is a finite resource and does the best with it.
-   In Permission Marketing, you must never spam. The key concept behind it is to only interact with the customer if he gives you permission. An example would be if he subscribed to your email newsletter by choice.

> Pay attention is a key phrase here, because permission marketers understand that when someone chooses to pay attention they actually are paying you with something valuable. And there’s no way they can get their attention back if they change their mind. Attention becomes an important asset, something to be valued, not wasted.

-   Real permission works like this: If you stop showing up, people are concerned. They ask where you went.
-   Subscriptions are an overt act of permission. Those customers are incredibly valuable.
-   In order to get permission, you make a promise. You say, "I will do x, y, and z; I hope you will give me permission by listening." And then - this is the hard part - that's all you do. You don't assume you can do more.
-   You don't assume that just because you're running for President or coming to the end of the quarter or launching a new product that you have the right to break the deal. You don't.

> Protect it. It’s more valuable than the laptops or chairs in your office. If someone walked out the door with those, you’d fire them. Act the same way if someone on your team spams the list just to make a metric go up

-   How do you get permission in the first place? How do you connect with people who want to hear more from you?

> When Marvel wants to launch a new superhero franchise, they don’t begin with nationwide TV ads. Instead, they go to San Diego Comic-Con.

-   It's almost impossible to spread your word directly. Too expensive, too slow. To find individuals, to interrupt them, and enroll them, one by one . . . it's a daunting task.
-   The alternative is to intentionally create a product or service that people decide it's worth talking about.

> It’s worth noting that whether something is remarkable isn’t up to you, the creator. You can do your best, but the final decision is up to your user, not you.

-   Ideas travel horizontally now: from person to person, not from organization to customer. We begin with the smallest possible core and give them something to talk about and reasons to do so.

> The hard work of creating the change you seek begins with designing evangelism into the very fabric of what you’re creating. People aren’t going to spread the word because it’s important to you. They’ll only do it because it’s important to them. Because it furthers their goals, because it permits them to tell a story to themselves that they’re proud of.

-   We're in a moment in time where more people are connected and fewer are trusted. There is a prevelance of fakes and ripoffs, and trust is endangered.
-   Into this vacuum of mistrust, marketers find themselves on one of three paths:
    -   Ignored
    -   Sneaking around
    -   Trusted

> If you’re ignored, you can’t accomplish much, because in addition to not earning trust, you haven’t earned attention either. If you’re sneaking around, pretending to be one thing while acting in a different way, you might be able to steal some attention and earn some faux trust, but it won’t last. The third method—trust—is the only one that pays for the investment required. And it’s nice that it’s also the easiest to live with.

-   The best way to earn trust is through action.

> We remember what you did long after we forget what you said

> Marketers spend a lot of time talking, and on working on what we’re going to say. We need to spend far more time doing. Talking means focusing on holding a press conference for the masses. Not talking means focusing on what you do when no one is watching, one person at a time, day by day.

-   Fame breeds trust, at least in our culture. People trust you not simply because they've heard of you, but because people they trust have heard of you as well.
    
-   Funnel*
    
-   Visualize a funnel, with a bunch of leaks and holes in it. At the top of the funnel, you pour attention. At the bottom of the funnel, commited loyal customers come out.
    
-   Between the top and the bottom, most people leak out. As people work their way through the funnel, the status of their trust changes. Perhaps they become more trusting, the result of cognitive dissonance and experience. Or, more likely, they become more distracted, more fearful, more eager to run away, because saying yes is more stressful than simply walking away.
    
-   How you can improve your funnel:
    

> 1.  You can make sure that the right people are attracted to it.

2.  You can make sure that the promise that brought them in aligns with where you hope they will go.
3.  You can remove steps so that fewer decisions are required.
4.  You can support those you’re engaging with, reinforcing their dreams and ameliorating their fears as you go.
5.  You can use tension to create forward motion.
6.  You can, most of all, hand those who have successfully engaged in the funnel a megaphone, a tool they can use to tell the others. People like us do things like this

-   When calculating funnel math, think hard about the lifetime value of a customer.*
    
-   If you only do the easy part, you will almost certainly be unhappy with the outcome.
    
-   The longtail*
    

> This means that living on the long tail has two essential elements:

1.  Creates the definitive, the most essential, the extraordinary contribution to the field.
2.  Connects the market you’ve designed it for, and helps them see that you belong in the short head. That this hit is the glue that holds them together.

-   What the early adopters want may be what the masses don't want.

> They don’t want to trade in their DVDs. They don’t want to learn a new software platform. They don’t want to read their news online.

-   Connected tribers are more powerful than disconnected ones.
-   The bridge* is built on two simple questions:
    -   What will I tell my friends?
    -   Why will I tell them?
-   It is never the case that people will tell their friends because you want them to, or because you ask them to, or because you worked hard.
-   Give them a why.
-   The Gartner Hype Cycle*
-   B2B stands for business to business — when a business sells something to another one.
-   The one question that every business buyer asks herself is, "What will I tell my boss?"
-   You're marketing the answer to that question: "If you choose this, you can tell your board/investors/boss that you...".
-   The marketer who is out of ideas or energy finishes that sentence with, ". . . bought the cheapest one".

> For the rest of us, there’s the opportunity to finish that sentence with a narrative about status, fear, affiliation, belonging, dominion, safety, commitment, insight, or any of the other emotions we’ve discussed

-   It's not your tribe. The tribe would probably survive if you went away. The goal is for them to miss you if you did.
-   There is a three step narrative for action:*
    -   The story of self
    -   The story of us
    -   The story of now
-   "I was like you. I was in the desert. Then I learned something and now I'm here" — Seth Godin
-   Manipulation is the tribe killer*

> Your opportunity as a marketer is the chance to connect the members of the tribe. They’re lonely and disconnected, they fear being unseen, and you, as the agent of change, can make connection happen.

-   The easy sales aren't always the important ones.

-   The method* isn't to go out and find an agent. The method is to do work so impossibly magical that agents and producers come looking for you.
-   What matters is the connection you made. Everyone has ten friends, fifty colleagues, a hundred acquaintances.
-   Tesla understood that no one who bought one of the first fifty thousand Teslas actually needed a car. They all had perfectly fine cars.

> Making a car that could have the impact the Tesla did on the story of luxury cars wasn’t easy. Musk chose to go to difficult extremes in positioning the car on behalf of his fans: it’s the fastest, the safest, and the most efficient car of its size, ever. All three. This audacity is available to more and more organizations as technology shifts from “Could it be done?” to “Do we have the guts?”

-   It's one thing to market to the world, but if feels quite different to market to one person . . . like your boss. Except it's not. Not really.*
    
-   Ship your work. It's good enough. Then make it better.
    
-   Is marketing evil?*
    

> Just like every powerful tool, the impact comes from the craftsman, not the tool. Marketing has more reach, with more speed, than it has ever had before. With less money, you can have more impact than anyone could have imagined just ten years ago. The question, one I hope you’ll ask yourself, is What are you going to do with that impact?

> If we’re going to take it personally every time someone doesn’t click on a link, every time someone doesn’t renew, we can’t possibly do our work as professionals. And thus we get stuck in search of perfect. Stuck without empathy. Stuck in a corner, bleeding and in pain, because we’ve been personally maligned. One way to avoid that is to realize that marketing is a process and a craft.

> If you are seeking to raise money for a charity, someone who donates a hundred or a thousand or a million dollars is only going to do it if they get more value than it costs them to donate. If you’re selling a widget for a thousand dollars, the only people who buy it will buy it because they believe it’s worth more than a thousand dollars.

> We may market to ourselves that we are struggling. We may tell ourselves that we are unknown and deserve to be unknown. We may tell ourselves that we’re a fake, a fraud, a manipulator. We may tell ourselves that we are unjustly ignored. They’re as true as we want them to be. And if you tell yourself a story enough times, you will make it true.
