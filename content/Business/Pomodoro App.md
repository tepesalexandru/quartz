We're building a pomodoro app that is based on networking people together.

The Front-End of the app is built with React and the back-end is based on Cloud Computing by using Azure

A key feature of this app is having Study Rooms

Study rooms could be planned in the future for people to participate in. Example:
LeetCode Study Session - Today at 9 PM (40 Peoples participating)

Integration with Discord only on our server. A bot that can help manage the app.

I need to choose a name for this app. The following are the current candidates:

*The name pomo in the app name makes it seem too generic*
PomoDo
PomoGarden
PomoNetwork
Pomoshare
PomoPeople
PomoCity
PomoCycle
PomoTime

FocusTimer
FocusTime

*Too generic, again*
TaskIt

AchieveIt
AchieveMore
AchieveTogether

*The app theme does not fit roots since we have a blue primary color instead of green*
StrongRoots
RootIt
IntertwinedTogether

*The term "grow" would've been good for the green app theme*
GrowIt
Lets Grow
GrowTogether


*App mottos*: 
- Gain an edge on achieving your goals. 
- Achieving our goals, together.

*Keywords*:
sharp, edge, progress, forward, motion, closer, community, approach, verge, hub
