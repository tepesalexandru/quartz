## What went well
- I've reached my desired weight
- My Medium audience has grown to 300+ followers
- I have increased my assets by 1,300 RON
- I've finished reading "This is Marketing" by Seth Godin
- I've completed 2 out of 4 goals marked as important
- I've started planning 2022 Master Plan|my goals for 2022
- I've calculated my capacity for the next year. (1009 hours)

## What didnt go well
- Tracking my progress on Week 52 has proven to be hard if I don't track each task immediately.
- Tracking my food calories has proven to be hard to remember if I don't note down the food I eat immediately or even beforehand.
- I have neglected waking up at 7:30 AM, I've been waking up at 8:30 AM instead.
- Looking at my goals I have noticed that many of them don't have a clear end. I should structure each one of my future goals with a clear end date. Also, each one of my future goals should have clear steps to follow to complete them.

## What can be improved
- Having 4 important goals again
- Waking up at 7:30 AM
-
