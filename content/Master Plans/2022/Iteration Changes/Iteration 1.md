### Iteration #1
#### Notes
> After some research, I've found that there is another possible Scrum certification I go for: **Professional Scrum Developer (PSD)**. I've talked to some colleagues at Qubiz, and also done some research online, and found out that the PSD certification is much harder than the PSM 1 certification.

Its still uncertain, but I think the best order of action would be going for the PSD certification after the PSM1 certification.

#### Conclusion & Changes
