title: "2022 Master Plan"
---
My 2022 capacity will be `1009 hours`, I've written an article about it [here](https://theboringteam.com/7-easy-steps-to-know-how-much-you-can-achieve-in-2022-d42bf182a5c8).

Base pillars of 2022:

*Note: A goal must be defiend clearly and must be in my control, it must also have a clear end destination to be marked as completed*

### Health
- Get dental implants done
- Work out on a regular basis (this isn't a clear goal with an end, must reformulate) ⭐
- Reduce my mental tiredness by reducing the amount of junk content that is consumed by my mind.
	- Reduce Netflix watchtime to (2 Episodes OR 1 Movie) / week. 
	- Reduce Youtube watchtime for ENTERTAINMENT to 1 hour / week.
	- Reduce any other social media (Instagram / Facebook) consumed time to 30 minutes / week.
	- => Total of ~4 hours / week of entertainment content consumed.
	- => Total of 4 hours x 52 weeks = 208 hours MAX of entertainment in 2022. 
	- These hours to not count for audio books / music/ courses etc.
- Shower every morning. Even if it's a quick 3-4 minutes. This helps kick the day off and be more productive and in a happier mood.

### Business
- Grow The Boring Team to a 5000 RON / month business (todo: define what is in my control)
- Publish a paid course (todo: define what kind of course and where)
- Grow online presence
	- Medium: 5000 Followers
		- Publish 100 Articles ⭐
	- Discord: 500 Members

### Financial
- Have 20,000 Euros saved up (maybe less savings and more investments?)
	- [Net worth forecast](https://1drv.ms/x/s!ApcHs7l0oRbYgms-eoMdZfG3Rmb0?e=llCl5c)
- Grow my assets to 10,000 Euros
- Have a personal income of 10,000 RON / month by the end of the year

### Knowledge
- [2022 Reading List](https://www.notion.so/c5f483d35ccc4e6fb30d92eff9c00dc9?v=e808a55c2ca1419281e3f91ba0707ab7) [402 hours] ⭐
	- Listen books instead of reading, could reduce reading time by half.
- Obtain the following certifications:
	- Azure DevOps Engineer (AZ-400)
	- Azure Solutions Architect Expert (AZ-303 + AZ-304)
	- Professional Scrum Master I ⭐
	- Professional Scrum Master II ⭐
	- Professional Scrum Master III
- Obtain an unbreakable knowledge about Data Structures & Algorithms.
	- This goal is for code interviews.

### Personal
- 26 Retrospective Sessions [13 Hours] ⭐
- 13 Anchoring Sessions. [6.5 Hours] ⭐

##### Important notes:
- Mental and physical health should be top notch priorities in 2022. I will do anything in my power to improve these 2 areas. Professional achievement grows a hundred times faster with a strong mind and body. Examples:
	- DON'T NUKE MY BRAIN.
	- Sleep well.
	- Don't overeat.
	- Limit junk content consumed by my mind.
	- Workout more.
	- Eat healthy food.
	- Don't drink too much coke.

- I want to leave my comfort zone as much as possible in 2022. This means going through hard and awkward conversations, trying something totally new or something risky. The more I leave my comfort zone the more I can grow.

- I must be in a flow state as much as I can during 2022, to always align with my goals such as they are both the right difficulty, the right direction and always keep me on the edge.

- What I have learned from my [[2021 Achievements]] is that the course of life constantly changes in a year. A part of the objectives will change dramatically in a year's time. An addition I want to make to my 2022 Masterplan is to constatly improve it throughout the year. This includes the following things:
	- Every other Sunday morning at 10 AM I will have a retrospective of how the master plan is going so far and what can be done to improve it. These will be called "Retrospective Sessions". Each Restrospective Session will be at max 30 minutes.
	- At every end of the month, I will make necessary changes to the 2022 masterplan. This can mean enhancements, discarding items, meditating if the direction I'm going in is correct and totally changing items. This will be done in direct relationship with the retrospective. These will be called "Anchoring Session". Each Anchoring Session will be at max 30 minutes.

- I want to only have meaningful bookmarks in my browser. Here are rules I want to apply to my 2022 and future bookmarks:
	- No music should be bookmarked (youtube or spotify etc.)
	- No "wish to explore" pages should be bookmarked. Instead, I will put interesting pages I want to explore in an Obsidian note.
	- Only truly essential pages should be bookmarked.
	- Articles must be put in the "Reading list" page, and must be read within 7 days.

- I want to have more output than input in 2022. This means producing more content than I consume. 

Ideas:
- Manage my week better using Google Calendar.

What/How do I want to be at the end of 2022?
