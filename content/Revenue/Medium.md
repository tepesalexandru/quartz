Notes to be better at growing the Medium account:

And no, despite any protests, it’s probably not because you’re not promoting it enough. Your blog isn’t getting results because your articles aren’t resonating with your readers…yet.

Whether you’re at the New York Times, BuzzFeed, or a blog powered by your company, people read your work to feel something. It might be curiosity, empowerment, or awe. Autodesk’s Global Head of Branded Content [Kylee Swenson Gordon](https://medium.com/revisionmagazine/kylee-swenson-gordon-when-a-story-doesnt-perform-very-well-i-always-look-at-the-headline-1c7babd003ef), says, “I know it’s not something you’re going to accomplish every time, but every once in a while I’ll get a story with a lead that is like, oh, that’s amazing. You feel something, and I think emotion is just so important in storytelling.”

Aim to Out-Teach Everyone Else

Focus on simple storytelling

A Business Systems to increase our Medium revenue:
#### I will focus on conquering the following 5 people to always read my articles:
1. [J. Martey](https://blisses.medium.com) - Digital Marketer
2. [Judy Derby](https://medium.com/@derbyj946) - Retired Social Worker
3. [Mohammed Nadir](https://mohammednadir.medium.com) - Copywriter
4. [Llewellyn (Lew) Daniels](https://llewdaniels.medium.com) - Personal Growth
5. [Jamie Northrup](https://medium.com/@minimalisthustler) - Online Business / Passive Income

To conquer the 5 people above I will do the following things every odd day:
- Give 10 claps to their latest article
- Leave a comment on their last article
- Optional: highlight something in their article


Rewards of winning my first battle on Medium: 5 Loyal Reads
Consequences:
- If I write 8 articles per month, each around 3 minutes of read time, then I will have a total of 24 minutes of read time per loyal reader.
- By having 5 loyal reads, that means I have 24 x 5 = 120 minutes of member read time / month
- Assuming that I receive 0.02$ / minute read, that means I will be generating a revenue of 120 x 0.02$ = 2.4$ / month (10.53 RON / month)


The plan above can be doubled by conquering other 5 people on even days. These are the following 5 people:
1. [Abbey Cross](https://medium.com/@across6786)
2. [Tom Kuegler](https://tomkuegler.medium.com)
3. [Christopher Kokoski](https://christopherkokoski.medium.com)




Idea:
write an article where I mention the 5 people above.
