Book Notes:

A 1% improvement every day will make you 37 times better in a year.

Building systems is a lot better than just setting goals. A goal is what you want, a system is how you get there.

We might see no difference by doing something once, by starting a new habit. But over time, our actions and decisions compound, and after some time you will break the platou and reach higher limites.

As an example, you might workout once, and see no difference. Workout for a month, and see no difference, but with time, you will get fit. It's not about what you do once. It's about what you do every single day that impacts your life and your outcomes.

The same habits produce the same outcomes. Change your habits and you will change your outcomes.

> TODO for self: Get better at building my systems, not setting goals. It's far important having a good system rather than just setting goals.

Breaking bad habits also takes time, but it's a matter of what we decide to do each day. Every single decision we make matters in the long run.

Even an average person with the right habits can become expectional. It's all about the compound effect of habits.

Every habit can be started instantly. Make it atomic, the smallest thing you can handle, and start from there. This can be applied to anything, such as working out, gaining knowledge, building a business and so on. Start small, grow from there.
