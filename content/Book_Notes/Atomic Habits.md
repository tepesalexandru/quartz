Book Notes:

A 1% improvement every day will make you 37 times better in a year.

Building systems is a lot better than just setting goals. A goal is what you want, a system is how you get there.

We might see no difference by doing something once, by starting a new habit. But over time, our actions and decisions compound, and after some time you will break the platou and reach higher limites.

As an example, you might workout once, and see no difference. Workout for a month, and see no difference, but with time, you will get fit. It's not about what you do once. It's about what you do every single day that impacts your life and your outcomes.

The same habits produce the same outcomes. Change your habits and you will change your outcomes.

> TODO for self: Get better at building my systems, not setting goals. It's far important having a good system rather than just setting goals.

Breaking bad habits also takes time, but it's a matter of what we decide to do each day. Every single decision we make matters in the long run.

Even an average person with the right habits can become expectional. It's all about the compound effect of habits.

Every habit can be started instantly. Make it atomic, the smallest thing you can handle, and start from there. This can be applied to anything, such as working out, gaining knowledge, building a business and so on. Start small, grow from there.

All habits are composed of 4 parts: trigger, craving, tension and reward.
Without the first three, a habit cannot be started, without the reward, it cannot last.

The best way to stop bad habits is to start by recognizing them and analyze when they happen. Then, when you're in the tension moment of a habit be present in the moment and say out loud what you were going to do and explain how that doesn't reflect your identity. It will stop.

Habits shape our identity, and our identity forms our habits.

Habits generate from exploring the world and finding a reward. Then, our brain associates the reward with the last few steps we've done. The next time we're repeating the same steps, the brain thinks of the reward. The more times we repeat the process, it becomes more automatic and we go on autopilot. This is why being conscious of the bad habits is key to stop them. Be present in the moment when you feel the craving and stop it with your will.

The more a habit is repeated, the easier it becomes. What this means is that fewer wrong moves are made, and more correct moves are made. This is very similar to machine learning and how they learn.
